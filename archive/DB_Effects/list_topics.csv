	 Absorption (EM radiation)		The process by which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. The electromagnetic energy is transformed to another form of energy, e.g. to heat.	
	 Absorption (physical)		A physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in which atoms, molecules, or ions enter some bulk phase - gas, liquid or solid material. This is a different from Adsorption, since the molecules are taken up by the volume, not by surface.	For example, by absorption of contaminants.
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	
	 Brazil Nut Effect		A phenomenon in which the largest particles end up on the surface when a granular material containing a mixture of objects of different sizes is shaken. Also known as the muesli effect.	
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	By separating the divided solid from contaminants.
	 Combustion		(or burning) A complex sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat or both heat and light in the form of either a glow or flames. Direct combustion by atmospheric oxygen is a reaction mediated by radical intermediates typically produced as a result of thermal runaway, where the heat generated by combustion is necessary to maintain the high temperature necessary for radical production.	
	 Convection		The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion)  and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general.	By first dispersing the divided solid in a fluid (liquid or gas).
	 Crystallisation		The (natural or artificial) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a identical solution or melt, or more rarely deposited directly from a gas. Crystallisation is also a chemical solid-liquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs.	
	 Decomposition (biological)		The break down of tissue of a formerly living organism into simpler forms of matter.	
	 Deflagration		A technical term describing subsonic combustion that usually propagates through thermal conductivity (hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it). Most 'fire' found in daily life, from flames to explosions, is technically deflagration. Deflagration is different from detonation (which is supersonic and propagates through shock compression).	
	 Density Gradient		Variation of density across an area or through a volume.	
	 Desorption		A phenomenon whereby a substance is released from or through a surface. The process is the opposite of sorption (i.e adsorption and absorption). This occurs in a system being in the state of sorption equilibrium between bulk phase (fluid, i.e. gas or liquid solution) and an adsorbing surface (solid or boundary separating two fluids). When the concentration (or pressure) of substance in the bulk phase is lowered, some of the sorbed substance changes to the bulk state.	
	 Diffusion		The movement of particles from a high concentration to a low concentration.	
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	For example, electrically conductive particles are slowed when falling though a magnetic field.
	 Enzyme		Proteins that catalyze (i.e., increase the rates of) chemical reactions. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates	
	 Exothermic Reaction		An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction accompanied by the release of heat. In other words, the energy needed for the reaction to occur is less than the total energy released. As a result of this, the extra energy is released, usually in the form of heat.	
	 Fermentation		In an industrial context, fermentation refers to the breakdown of organic substances and re-assembly into other substances.

	 Ostwald Ripening		An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets.

The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a fluid medium.	By moving particles according to their optical properties, it is possible to separate them from other particles that may have similar aerodynamic properties.
	 Porosity		The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.	
	 Redox Reactions		Redox (shorthand for oxidation-reduction) reactions describe all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation number (oxidation state) changed. This can be either a simple redox process, such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon dioxide (CO2) or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH4), or a complex process such as the oxidation of sugar(C6H12O6) in the human body through a series of complex electron transfer processes.	
	 Reverse Brazil Nut Effect		Under certain conditions the reverse of the Brazil Nut Effect (granular separation) can occur i.e. following vibration or agitation large beads fall to the bottom of a container, and small beads rising to the top of the container.	
	 Sorption		The action of both absorption and adsorption taking place simultaneously, i.e. the effect of gases or liquids being incorporated into a material of a different state and adhering to the surface of another molecule. Absorption is the incorporation of a substance in one state into another of a different state (e.g., liquids  absorbed by solid or gas absorbed by liquid). Adsorption is the physical adherence or bonding of ions and molecules onto the surface of another molecule.	
	 Sublimation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter directly from solid phase to gaseous phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase.	
	 Superhydrophilicity		Under light irradiation, water dropped onto titanium dioxide forms no contact angle (almost 0 degrees). This effect is called superhydrophilicity. Examples of uses: defogging glass, enabling oil spots to be swept away by water, door mirrors for cars, coatings for buildings, self-cleaning glass, etc. Another use is the property of self-cleaning by the photodecomposition of dirt such as organic compounds adsorbed on the surface.

Regarded as 'positive' when molecules move from hot to cold and 'negative' when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibits positive behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative.	For example, separation by particle size.
	 Acoustic Emission		Transient elastic waves within a material due to localised stress release. Acoustic Emission (AE) events can occur rapidly when materials begin to fail. AE events commonly studied include the extension of a fatigue crack, or fibre breakage in composite materials. AE is related to an irreversible release of energy, and can be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact.

	 Ampère's Force Law		Ampere's Force Law decribes the force of attraction or repulsion between two current-carrying wires.	
	 Auger Effect		When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of energy. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted photon, in the case of the Auger Effect,  the energy is instead transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom.

	 Diamagnetism		The property of an object which causes it to create a magnetic field in opposition of an externally applied magnetic field, thus causing a repulsive effect. It is a form of magnetism that is only exhibited by a substance in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Diamagnetism is generally a quite weak effect in most materials, although superconductors exhibit a strong effect.	
	 Dorn Effect		(aka Sedimentation Potential). Potential difference resulting from motion of particles through water, typically due to gravity or centrifugation. The motion disrupts equilibrium symmetry of particle's double layer, viscous flow around the particles drags ions of the diffuse layer from them causing slight displacement between surface charge & electric charge of the diffuse layer, giving the particle a dipole moment, generating electric field.	
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.

Electrostatic induction should not be confused with electromagnetic induction; both are often referred to as 'induction'.	
	 Ettingshausen Effect		(or Second Nernst-Ettingshausen Effect) A thermoelectric (or thermomagnetic) phenomenon that affects electric current in a conductor when a magnetic field is present, resulting in a potential difference is induced normal to both the direction of the magnetic field and the current. Alternately, a temperature gradient is induced. The inverse of the Nernst Effect.	
	 Explosion		A sudden increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases.	
	 Fluorescence		Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of a photon triggers the emission of a photon with a longer (less energetic) wavelength. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as molecular rotations, vibrations or heat. Sometimes the absorbed photon is in the ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range.	
	 Fractoluminescence		The emission of light from the fracture (rather than rubbing) of a crystal. Depending upon the atomic and molecular composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures a charge separation can occur making one side of the fractured crystal +ve charged and the other side -ve charged. As in triboluminescence, if the charge separation results in a large enough electric potential, a discharge across the gap and through the bath gas between the interfaces can occur.

Infrared radiation spans roughly three orders of magnitude (750 nm and 1000 µm).	From energy of incident  infrared radiation.
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.

	 Ion Wind		A stream of ionized fluid generated by a strong electric field (typically a sharp conductive point) exceeding the corona discharge inception voltage gradient, ionizing the air about the tip, creating a small jet of plasma. Ionised air molecules have the same polarity as the charged tip, so are replused as a like-charged ion cloud, that expands due to the repulsion between ions, creating an electric 'wind' and a hissing noise due to pressure change.	
	 Joule Heating		The process by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor releases heat. Heat generated is a function of current, resistance and time. Also known as the Joule-Lenz effect, Ohmic heating or resitive heating.

	 Lorentz Force		The force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). 	
	 Luminescence		The generation of light that usually occurs at low temperatures, and is thus a form of cold body radiation. It can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or stress on a crystal. This distinguishes luminescence from incandescence, which is light generated by high temperatures.	
	 Magnetic Hysteresis		"Hysteresis phenomena occur in magnetic and ferromagnetic materials, as well as in the elastic, electric, and magnetic behavior of materials, in which a lag occurs between the application and the removal of a force or field and its subsequent effect.
Magnetic field hysteresis loss causes heating. This effect is used in induction cooking, where an alternating magnetic field causes a ferrite container to heat directly rather than being heated by an external heat-source."

	 Piezoluminescence		Luminescence produced by the action of pressure on certain solids	
	 Plasma		A partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter.	
	 Pyroelectric Effect		The ability of certain materials to generate an electrical potential when they are heated or cooled. As a result of this change in temperature, positive and negative charges move to opposite ends through migration (i.e. the material becomes polarized) and hence, an electrical potential is established.	Generation of electric potential

	 Thermionic Emission		Emission of electrons or ions caused by thermal vibrational energy . Also known as the Edison Effect.	Can be used for power generation through the emission of electrons.
	 Thermoacoustic Effect		Acoustic waves can be used for heat transfer. The pressure variations in the acoustic wave are accompanied by temperature variations due to compressions and expansions of the gas which, being inherantly associated with a displacement, results in a net transfer of heat. Direction of heat flow can be fixed by, for example, a standing wave pattern generated by an acoustic resonator. 	
	 Thermoluminescence		A form of luminescence that is exhibited by certain crystalline materials, such as some minerals, when previously absorbed energy from electromagnetic radiation or other ionizing radiation is re-emitted as light upon heating of the material.

	 Coanda Effect		The tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent suitably shaped curved surface. Also applies to powdered solids.	
	 Convection		The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion)  and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general.	
	 Electric Field		The space surrounding an electric charge or in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field has a property called an electric field (that can also be equated to electric flux density).

	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	In the case of ionised gas.
	 Inertia		The resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion or rest. It is proportional to an object's mass. 	
	 Laminar Flow		(sometimes known as streamline flow) Occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers. In fluid dynamics, laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion, low momentum convection, pressure and velocity independent from time. It is the opposite of turbulent flow. In nonscientific terms laminar flow is 'smooth,' while turbulent flow is 'rough.'	
	 Metastability		A general scientific concept which describes states of delicate equilibrium. A system is in a metastable state when it is in equilibrium (not changing with time) but is susceptible to fall into lower-energy states with only slight interaction.

The dominant flow in a vortex ring is said to be toroidal, more precisely poloidal. Within a stationary body of fluid, a vortex ring can travel for relatively long distance, carrying the spinning fluid with it.	
	 Absorption (physical)		A physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in which atoms, molecules, or ions enter some bulk phase - gas, liquid or solid material. This is a different from Adsorption, since the molecules are taken up by the volume, not by surface.	
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	For example, activated carbon used to purify air by adsorption of gases
	 Capillary Condensation		The process by which multilayer adsorption from the vapour phase into a porous medium proceeds to the point at which pore spaces become filled with condensed liquid from the vapour phase. The unique aspect of capillary condensation is that vapor condensation occurs below the saturation vapor pressure of the pure liquid.

	 Corona Discharge		An electrical discharge brought on by the ionization of a fluid surrounding a conductor, which occurs when the potential gradient (the strength of the electric field) exceeds a certain value, but conditions are insufficient to cause complete electrical breakdown or arcing.	For example, Corona Discharge can be used to remove particulate matter from air streams by first charging the air, and then passing the charged stream through a comb of alternating polarity, to deposit the charged particles onto oppositely charged plates.
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet.

	 Electro-Osmosis		(also called electroendosmosis) The motion of polar liquid through a membrane or other porous structure (generally, along charged surfaces of any shape and also through non-macroporous materials which have ionic sites and allow for water uptake, the latter sometimes referred to as 'chemical porosity' ) under the influence of an applied electric field.	
	 Electrostatics		The phenomena arising from stationary or slowly moving electric charges	For example, by attraction of solid particles out of a gas stream.

By breaking down organic contaminants.
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation.

Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	For example, removing ferromagnetic metal contaminants dispersed in the gas.
	 Permeation		The penetration of a permeate (such as a liquid, gas, or vapour) through a solid. The permeate always migrates to the lower concentration in three steps:  1. Sorption (at the interface); 2. Diffusion (through the solid); 3. Desorption (the adsorbate leaves the solid as a gas).	
	 Photo-oxidation		Oxidation facilitated radiant energy such as UV or artificial light. This process is often the most significant component of weather degradation of polymers.	
	 Photodissociation		A chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound. Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher, such as ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions.	
	 Settling		The process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base. 	
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. Additionally, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties to be 'tuned'.	
	 Thermophoresis		(also called thermodiffusion or Soret Effect) The effect of temperature gradient on multicomponent (or isotopic) mixtures of particles (i.e. particle movement from hotter to colder regions or vice versa). Regarded as 'positive' when molecules move from hot to cold and 'negative' when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibits positive behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative.	By moving particles within a gas stream.
	 Abrasion		The process of scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, or rubbing away. It can be intentionally imposed in a controlled process using an abrasive. 	
	 Acoustic Cavitation		Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse.  High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries.	
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate).

Polymer-based compounds 
"	By adsorbing surface contaminants onto an adsorbent material. For example, wiping a surface with a cloth or sponge to remove moisture and/or dirt.
	 Brinelling		Surface fatigue caused by repeated impact or overloading.	
	 Cavitation		The formation of vapour bubbles in a flowing liquid in a region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure. Usually divided into two classes of behavior. Inertial (or transient) cavitation occurs when a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to energy input, e.g. acoustic field.

The charge transport may result as a response to an electric field, or as a result of a concentration gradient in carrier density, that is, by diffusion . 	Through heating resulting from the flow of current.
	 Conservation of Momentum		In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with the outside and is not acted on by outside forces) the total momentum is constant.	For example, the Newton's Cradle executive toy.
	 Crevice Corrosion		Corrosion occurring in spaces having limited access to working fluid from the environment, such as gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams. Generally occurs due to high concentration of impurities in the crevice (e.g., chlorides, acid, or base), or differential electrolyte chemistry inside and outside the crevice: a single metal part being submerged in two different environments. 	
	 Detonation		Detonation involves a supersonic exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a shock front propagating directly in front of it. Detonations are observed in both conventional solid and liquid explosives, as well as in reactive gases.

	 Melting		A process that results in the phase change of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a solid substance is increased (typically by the absorbtion of heat) to a specific temperature (called the melting point) at which it changes to the liquid phase. 	
	 Physisorption		(or physical adsorption) A type of adsorption in which the adsorbate adheres to the surface only through Van der Waals (weak intermolecular) interactions, which are also responsible for the non-ideal behaviour of real gases.	
	 Pyrolysis		A thermochemical decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis typically occurs under pressure and at operating temperatures above 430 °C (800 °F). Pyrolysis is a special case of thermolysis.	
	 Pyrophoricity		A pyrophoric substance ignites spontaneously in air at or below 55 degrees centigrade. The creation of sparks from metals is based on the pyrophoricity of small metal particles. The sparking mechanism in cigarette lighters is an example. Some liquids and gases are phyrophoric.	
	 Solvation		(commonly called dissolution) The process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute. As ions dissolve in a solvent they spread out and become surrounded by solvent molecules. The bigger the ion, the more solvent molecules are able to surround it and the more it becomes solvated.	
	 Sound		A mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing and of a level sufficiently strong to be heard.	Used in some cleaning applications (e.g. cleaning teeth, especially when coupled using a liquid medium)
	 Sputtering		A process whereby atoms are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment of the target by energetic ions. It is commonly used for thin-film deposition, etching and analytical techniques	For example, Ion Beam Sputtering can be used to polish telescope mirrors.

In the case of a solid floating on or suspended in a fluid subject to tidal flow.

	 Vacuum		A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum.	
	 Vibration		Mechanical oscillations about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.	
	 Wear		The erosion of material from a solid surface by the action of another surface.	
	 Weathering		The breaking down of Earth's rocks, soils and minerals through direct contact with the planet's atmosphere. Weathering occurs in situ, or 'with no movement', and thus should not be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, wind, and gravity. 	
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	By adsorping water or water vapour.
	 Capillary Action		(capillarity, capillary motion, wicking) The movement of a liquid relative to a substance in contact. A result of the adhesive intermolecular forces between the liquid and the substance being stronger (or weaker)  than the cohesive intermolecular forces inside the liquid. Causes a concave (or concave) meniscus to form where the liquid touches the surface. Can cause raising or lowering (e.g. mercury in glass) of the liquid.	
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	Examples include spin-dyers for clothes and salad spinners.
	 Dielectric Heating		(also known as electronic heating, RF heating, high-frequency heating) The phenomenon in which radiowave or microwave electromagnetic radiation heats a dielectric material, especially as caused by dipole rotation.	
	 Electrolysis		A method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes. 	By electrolysis of the water.
	 Electrowetting		(or Electrocapillary Effect) The modification of the wetting properties of a hydrophobic surface with an applied electric field.	
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	For example, by fluidising using warm air.
	 Forced Convection		Heat advection by a fluid which is not due to the natural forces of buoyancy induced by heating. In forced heat convection, transfer of heat is due to movement in the fluid which results from many other forces, such as (for example) a fan or pump.	
	 Free Convection		Movement of molecules of fluids (or gases) dues to density differences in the fluid (or gas) occurring due to temperature gradients. 	
	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.	
	 Hydrophobe		The physical property of a molecule (known as a hydrophobe) that is repelled from a mass of water. Hydrophobic molecules tend to be non-polar and thus prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents. Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together forming micelles. Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle.	
	 Latent Heat		Energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process. An example is a state of matter change, meaning a phase transition, such as ice melting or water boiling.	Through heating.
	 Lotus Leaf Effect		The leaves of the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo) are characterized by a very high water repellency (superhydrophobicity). Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to a complex micro- and nanoscopic architecture of the surface which enables minimisation of adhesion.	
	 Marangoni Effect		(or Gibbs-Marangoni effect)  The presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).	For example,  liquid spots left on silicon wafer surfaces are removed by blowing an alcohol vapor over the wet wafer surface and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface.
	 Mixed Convection		Movement of fluids or gases (or particles carried by fluids or gasses) by a combination of Free and Forced Convection	
	 Osmosis		A physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations.Osmosis releases energy, and can be made to do work.	
	 Porosity		The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.	By absorbing water into a porous material.
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. Additionally, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties to be 'tuned'.	Supercritical drying is a method of removing solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the supercritical fluid can be removed without distortion. Supercritical drying is used for manufacture of aerogels and drying of delicate materials such as archeological samples and biological samples for electron microscopy.
	 Surface Tension		An attractive property of the surface of a liquid. It is what causes the surface portion of liquid to be attracted to another surface, such as that of another portion of liquid (as in connecting bits of water or as in a drop of mercury that forms a cohesive ball).	
	 Transpiration		The loss of water vapour from parts of plants (similar to sweating), especially in leaves but also in stems, flowers and roots. Leaf surfaces are dotted with openings called, collectively, stomata. Leaf transpiration occurs through stomata, and can be thought of as a necessary 'cost' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots.	
	 Ultrasonic Vibration		Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.	For example, ultrasonic vibration has been proposed to improve the drying performance of dishwashers.
	 Wetting		The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.	By wetting another object, thus drawing water from the object to be dried.
	 Advection		A transport mechanism of a substance, or a conserved property, by a fluid, due to the fluid's bulk motion in a particular direction. An example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river. 	In the case of a powdered or granular solid.
	 Brownian Motion		The random movement of particles suspended in a liquid or gas	
	 Chemical Bonding		The physical process responsible for the attractive interactions between atoms and molecules, and which confers stability to diatomic and polyatomic chemical compounds. In general, chemical bonding is associated with the sharing of electrons between the participating atoms. Molecules, crystals, and diatomic gases and most of the physical environment around us are held together by chemical bonds.	
	 Convection		The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion)  and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general.	In the case of a powdered or granular solid.
	 Diffusion		The movement of particles from a high concentration to a low concentration.	Diffusion of molecules of one solid into another.
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	
	 Mechanical Force		A mechanical influence that causes a free body to undergo an acceleration.	
	 Sound		A mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing and of a level sufficiently strong to be heard.	Can be used for mixing powders.
	 Suspension		A heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid - which may be liquid or gas) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. 	Solid particles can be 'mixed' with gas or liquid in the form of a suspension.
	 Turbulence		A fluid regime characterised by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time (flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow).	For solid particles suspended in a liquid or gas.
	 Absorptive Filter		A filter that absorbes some wavelengths of incident radiation whilst transmitting others.	
	 Christiansen Effect		A narrow bandpass or monochromatic optical filter which consists of an optical cell which is stuffed with a crushed substance (e.g. glass) and a (mostly organic) liquid.	
	 Depth of Field		In optics, particularly as it relates to film and photography, depth of field is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image.	
	 Focusing		The gathering of wavefronts of a wave (e.g. radiation) into a spherical or cylindical shape. Focusing of light is used in optics, however focusing can be applied to any radiation or wave.	
	 Magnetic Saturation		Seen in some magnetic materials, saturation is the state reached when an increase in applied external magnetising field cannot increase the magnetisation of the material further, so the total magnetic field levels off. It is a characteristic particularly of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys.	
	 Phononic Crystal		A phononic crystal is a material which exhibits stop bands for phonons, preventing phonons of selected ranges of frequencies from being transmitted through the material.	
	 Boiling		A type of phase transition. The rapid vaporisation of a liquid, which typically occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure.	
	 Capillary Evaporation		The transport of a liquid from within a capillary system (e.g. a block of porous material) and the subsequent evaporation from its surface.	
	 Corona Discharge		An electrical discharge brought on by the ionization of a fluid surrounding a conductor, which occurs when the potential gradient (the strength of the electric field) exceeds a certain value, but conditions are insufficient to cause complete electrical breakdown or arcing.	For example, Corona Discharge can be used in the manufacture of ozone.
	 Depressurisation		Reduction in pressure. Rapid depressurisation can be used to create pressure differences.	
	 Electrolysis		A method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes. 	
	 Entropic Explosion		An explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat. 	
	 Evaporation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter from  liquid phase to gaseous phase. 	
	 Exothermic Reaction		An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction accompanied by the release of heat. In other words, the energy needed for the reaction to occur is less than the total energy released. As a result of this, the extra energy is released, usually in the form of heat.	By evaporation of a liquid
	 Heating		The act of increasing temperature.	By evaporation of a liquid
	 Leidenfrost Effect		A phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapour layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. Due to this repulsive force, the droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. Commonly seen in the case of droplets of water skittering across a very hot metal surface.	
	 Nucleation		The extremely localised budding of a distinct thermodynamic phase. Some examples of phases that may form via nucleation in liquids are gaseous bubbles, crystals or glassy regions. Creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor is also characterized by nucleation. Most nucleation processes are physical, rather than chemical, but a few exceptions do exist (e.g. electrochemical nucleation). 	
	 Pressure Drop		Pressure is an effect which occurs when a force is applied on a surface. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid normal to these boundaries or sections at every point. Rapid pressure drop is a useful technique for applying force or breaking objects apart.	
	 Acoustic Radiation Pressure		A force on a particle suspended in the field of a sound wave arising from the scattering of the acoustic waves on the particle.	
	 Aerosol		A suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas. 	
	 Angular Momentum		Angular momentum is the rotational counterpart of momentum. A spinning flywheel has angular momentum.	
	 Angular Momentum Conservation		In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.	
	 Antibubble		A droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a thin film of liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water (e.g. water globules), or be completely submerged in the liquid to which they are directed.	For example, antibubbles, with water inside and water outside, have positive buoyancy and tend to rise towards the water surface. Antibubbles containing a heavier liquid will have negative buoyancy and hence sink.
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	By buoyant movement of a less dense liquid through a denser one. Similarly a liquid carried in a solid container with a combined density lower than the surrounding medium.
	 Barus Effect		A viscoelastic effect. A phenomenon in which the diameter of fluid becomes larger than the diameter of a nozzle at its exit when the fluid is extruded through the nozzle.	
	 Bernoulli Effect		For an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's gravitational potential energy	For example, the movement of fuel in a venturi carburettor.
	 Boiling		A type of phase transition. The rapid vaporisation of a liquid, which typically occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure.	For example, through evaporation and subsequent condensation (as in distillation)
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	
	 Capillary Pressure		The difference in pressure across the interface between two immiscible fluids. This pressure difference is proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the effective radius of the interface. It also depends on the wetting angle of the liquid on the surface of the capillary.	
	 Capillary Wave Effect		A wave travelling along the interface between two fluids, whose dynamics are dominated by the effects of surface tension. Capillary waves are common in nature and home, and are often referred to as ripple. The wavelength of capillary waves is typically less than a few centimeters. A gravity-capillary wave on a fluid interface is influenced by both the effects of surface tension and gravity, as well as by the fluid inertia.	
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	
	 Coffee Ring Effect		A pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. Named after the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. The pattern is due to capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.	
	 Colloid		A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve. 	
	 Compression		The result of the subjection of a material to compressive stress, resulting in reduction of volume. The opposite of compression is tension. In simple terms, compression is a pushing force.	
	 Conic Capillary Effect		A conical capillary tube results in a meniusci having different curvature, This causes the liquid to flow in the direction of of the meniscus having the greater curvature.	
	 Conservation of Momentum		In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with the outside and is not acted on by outside forces) the total momentum is constant.	
	 Converse Piezoelectric Effect		Materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the production of electricity when stress is applied) also exhibit the converse piezoelectric effect (the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension.	
	 Coriolis Force		"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern.

	 Darwin Drift		The phenomenon that a fluid parcel is permanently displaced after the passage of a body through a fluid  the fluid being at rest far away from the body.	
	 Diamagnetism		The property of an object which causes it to create a magnetic field in opposition of an externally applied magnetic field, thus causing a repulsive effect. It is a form of magnetism that is only exhibited by a substance in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Diamagnetism is generally a quite weak effect in most materials, although superconductors exhibit a strong effect.	If a thin (under 0.5 cm) layer of water is placed on top of a powerful magnet (such as a super magnet) then the field of the magnet repels the water. This causes a slight dimple in the water's surface that may be seen by its reflection.
	 Displacement		Displacement occurs when an object is immersed in a fluid, pushing the fluid out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the object imersed. An object that sinks, or is otherwise fully immersed, displaces an amount of fluid equal to its total volume. 	
	 Ekman layer		The layer in a fluid where there is a force balance between pressure gradient force, Coriolis force and turbulent drag.  In addition to enforcing the zero velocity condition at the wall, these Ekman layers can also control long-range properties of the flow. A classical illustration is given by the everyday experience of how a cup of tea returns to rest after stirring. 	
	 Elasticity		The physical property of a material when it deforms under stress (e.g. external forces), but returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. The amount of deformation is called the strain. The elastic regime is characterized by a linear relationship between stress and strain, denoted linear elasticity. 	Some non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic fluids, will also exhibit elasticity in certain conditions. In response to a small, rapidly applied and removed strain, these fluids may deform and then return to their original shape. Under larger strains, or strains applied for longer periods of time, these fluids may start to flow, exhibiting viscosity.
	 Electric Field		The space surrounding an electric charge or in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field has a property called an electric field (that can also be equated to electric flux density). This electric field exerts a force on other electrically charged objects. 	If the liquid carries an electric charge.
	 Electrohydrodynamics		Includes the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms:Electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.	Shaped electrostatic fields create hydrostatic pressure (or motion) in dielectric media. When such media are fluids, a flow is produced.
	 Electrostatics		The phenomena arising from stationary or slowly moving electric charges	
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	In the case of a ferrofluid.
	 Flow Separation		For a solid object travelling through a fluid (or alternatively a stationary object exposed to a moving fluid) flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer falls almost to zero.The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices.	
	 Fluid Hammer		A pressure surge or wave resulting when a fluid in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly (Momentum Change). Water hammer commonly occurs when a valve is closed suddenly at an end of a pipeline system, and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe.	
	 Flutter		A dynamic instability of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow.	
	 Force		That which can cause an object with mass to accelerate. Force has both magnitude & direction, i.e. it's a vector quantity. An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure.	
	 Gel		A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).	
	 Gravitational Convection (non heat)		Differential buoyancy forces which cause convection in gravity fields may result from sources of density variations in fluids other than those produced by heat, such as variable composition. For example, diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil assisted by the mechanism of the fact that saline is heavier than fresh water.	
	 Harmonic Oscillator		A system which, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force proportional to the displacement. Mechanical examples include pendula (with small angles of displacement) and masses connected to springs.	A liquid held in a U tube can act as a harmonic oscillator (albeit one that is heavily damped)
	 Hydraulic Jump		When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) occurs in the liquid surface. The liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself.	
	 Impact Force		A high force or shock applied over a short time period. Such a force or acceleration can sometimes have a greater effect than a lower force applied over a proportionally longer time period.	
	 Kármán Vortex Street		A repeating pattern of swirling vortices caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid over bluff bodies. It is responsible for such phenomena as the 'singing' of suspended telephone or power lines, the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds.	
	 Kaye Effect		A property of complex liquids, common in shear-thinning liquids (liquids which thin under shear stress). While pouring one the liquid onto a surface, the surface suddenly spouts an upcoming jet of liquid which merges with the downgoing one. Common household liquids with this property are liquid hand soaps, shampoos and non-drip paint. The effect usually goes unnoticed, however, because it seldom lasts more than about 300ms.	
	 Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability		A fluid interface that can occur when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid, or where there is a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. An example is wind blowing over water: The instability manifests in waves on the water surface. More generally, clouds, the ocean, Saturn's bands, and the sun's corona show this instability.	
	 Lorentz Force		The force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). 	A liquid conducting electricity and passing through a perpendicular magnetic field experiences a Lorenz Force. This can be used to implement a pump.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	For example, in the case of a ferromagnetic liquid or one moved by a ferromanetic solid in contact with the liquid.
	 Magnetoelastic Effects		A group of effects including Magnetostriction (or Joule Magnetostriction), Delta-E Effect, Wiedemann Effect, Magnetovolume Effect, and their Inverses: Villari Effect, Delta-E Effect, Matteucci Effect and the Nagaoka-Honda Effect.	In the case of a magnetic liquid.
	 Magnetohydrodynamic Effect		A magnetic field can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which create forces on the fluid, and also change the magnetic field itself.	In microfluidic devices, the MHD pump is so far the most effective for producing a continuous, nonpulsating flow in a complex microchannel design
	 Magnetostriction		A property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetisation. The variation of material's magnetisation due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value. This effect can cause losses due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores.	In the case of a magnetic liquid.
	 Magnus Effect		The phenomenon whereby a spinning object flying in a fluid creates a whirlpool of fluid around itself, and experiences a force perpendicular to the line of motion and away from the direction of spin. The overall behaviour is similar to that around an aerofoil with a circulation which is generated by the mechanical rotation, rather than by aerofoil action.	
	 Marangoni Effect		(or Gibbs-Marangoni effect)  The presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).	Since a liquid with high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension causes the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient - ethanol concentration, in the case of 'tears of wine' - or by a temperature gradient. (Surface tension is a function of temperature.)
	 Mechanocaloric Effect		An effect resulting from the fact that a temperature gradient in helium II is invariably accompanied by a pressure gradient, and conversely; examples are the fountain effect, and the heating of liquid helium left behind in a container when part of it leaks out through a small orifice.	
	 Negative Thermal Expansion		A physicochemical process in which some materials contract upon heating rather than expanding as most materials do. Materials which undergo this unusual process have a range of potential engineering, photonic, electronic, and structural applications. For example, mixing a negative thermal expansion material with a 'normal' material which expands on heating, could result in a zero expansion composite material.	Either directly or, for example, via piston
	 Onnes Effect		The ability of superfluid liquids to cross obstacles that lie at a higher level. The Onnes Effect is enabled by the capillary forces dominating the gravity and viscous forces.	
	 Opto-hydraulic Effect		When laser pulses are absorbed in a liquid layer, high power acoustic pulses are generated. They produce a high hydrostatic pressure which causes the liquid to be ejected in the direction of the laser beam	
	 Pascal's Law		(or the Principle of transmission of fluid-pressure) Pressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid such that the pressure ratio (initial difference) remains same.	
	 Photophoresis		The phenomenon that small particles suspended in gas (aerosols) or liquids (hydrocolloids) starts to migrate when illuminated by a sufficiently intense beam of light. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a fluid medium.	For an aerosol.
	 Piezoelectric Effect		Generation of electrical charge  in certain solid materials (notably crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins) in response to applied mechanical strain.  The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process in that materials also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical force resulting from an applied electrical field).	Indirectly using a piezoelectric actuator. For example, nn many inkjet printers, piezoelectric crystals are used to drive the ejection of ink from the inkjet print head towards the paper
	 Pressure Gradient		A fluid (gas or liquid) subject to a pressure gradient results in a net force that is directed from high to low pressure (the 'pressure gradient force'). 	
	 Rayleigh-Taylor Instability		An instability of an interface between two fluids of different densities, which occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier fluid.	
	 Reaction (physics)		In classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that forces occur in pairs: the Action and the Reaction. Both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The distinction between action and reaction is purely arbitrary: any one of the two forces can be considered an action, in which case the other (corresponding) force automatically becomes its associated reaction.	
	 Reverse Diffusion		A situation where the transport of particles (atoms or molecules) in a medium occurs towards regions of lower concentration gradients, opposite to that observed during diffusion. This phenomenon occurs during phase separation.	
	 Reverse Osmosis		The process of forcing a solvent from a region of high solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane to a region of low solute concentration by applying a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure. The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side. It is most often applied as a filter. 	
	 Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability		An instability in the interface between between fluids of differing density that occurs when they are impulsively accelerated, e.g. by the passage of a shock wave.	
	 Shock Wave		A type of propagating disturbance. Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or through a field such as the electromagnetic field. Characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Associated with rapid rise in pressure, temperature and density of the flow. A shock wave travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave.	
	 Solvation		(commonly called dissolution) The process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute. As ions dissolve in a solvent they spread out and become surrounded by solvent molecules. The bigger the ion, the more solvent molecules are able to surround it and the more it becomes solvated.	Both solvent and solute can be considered to 'move' during solvation.
	 Sound		A mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing and of a level sufficiently strong to be heard.	
	 Stokes Drift		The movement of a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow due to wave motion.	
	 Supercavitation		"The use of cavitation effects to create a large bubble of gas inside a liquid, allowing an object to travel at great speed through the liquid by being wholly enveloped by the bubble. The cavity (the bubble) reduces the drag on the object and this makes supercavitation an attractive technology; drag is normally about 1,000 times greater in water than in air.
"	
	 Superfluidity		A state of matter in which viscosity of a fluid vanishes, while thermal conductivity becomes infinite. These unusual effects are observed when liquids, typically of helium-4 or helium-3, overcome friction in surface interaction at a stage (known as the 'lambda point', which is temperature and pressure, for helium-4) at which the liquid's viscosity becomes zero.	
	 Surface Acoustic Wave		(SAW) An acoustic wave traveling along the surface of a material having some elasticity, with an amplitude that typically decays exponentially with the depth of the substrate. This kind of wave is commonly used in devices called SAW devices in electronics circuits. 	In recent years, attention has been drawn to using SAWs to drive microfluidic actuation and a variety of processes. Owing to the mismatch of sound velocities in the SAW substrate and fluid, SAWs can be efficiently transferred into the fluid, to create significant inertial force and fluid velocities. This mechanism can be exploited to drive fluid actions such as pumping, mixing, jetting, as well as others
	 Temperature Gradient		The variation in temperature over distance.	
	 Thermal Contraction		The tendency of matter to reduce in volume (contract)  in response to a change in temperature or when a substance is cooled.	
	 Thermal Expansion		The tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature or when a substance is heated.	
	 Thermo-capillary Convection		Mass transfer along an interface between two fluids due to a surface tension gradient, where the surface tension gradient is caused by a temperature gradient.	
	 Thermomechanical Effect		One of the most spectacular results of the properties of superfluids is known as the thermomechanical or 'fountain effect'. If a capillary tube is placed into a bath of superfluid helium and then heated, even by shining a light on it, the superfluid helium will flow up through the tube and out the top.	
	 Thermophoresis		(also called thermodiffusion or Soret Effect) The effect of temperature gradient on multicomponent (or isotopic) mixtures of particles (i.e. particle movement from hotter to colder regions or vice versa). Regarded as 'positive' when molecules move from hot to cold and 'negative' when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibits positive behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative.	
	 Thixotropy		The property of some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite amount of time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated.	
	 Tidal Force		A situation in which a body or material (for example, tidal water, or the Moon) is mainly under the gravitational influence of a second body (for example, the Earth), but is also perturbed by the gravitational effects of a third body (for example, by the Moon in the case of tidal water, or by the Sun in the case of the Moon).	
	 Ultrasonic Capillary Effect		Abnormally high rise of a liquid and its penetration into capillary channels due to a high-intensity ultrasound field. Caused by the collapse of cavitation bubbles at the capillary inlet. A collaping bubble generates a liquid microjet, the penetration of which into capillary channel causes the height increment of the capillary liquid column. Summation of such increments lies behind the increase of a height and a velocity of the liquid rise in a capillary under the ultrasound action. 	
	 Vapour Pressure		The pressure of a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases in a closed system. All liquids and solids have a tendency to evaporate into a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency to condense back to their liquid or solid form.	
	 Venturi Effect		The reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe. The fluid velocity must increase through the constriction to satisfy the equation of continuity, while its pressure must decrease due to conservation of energy: the gain in kinetic energy is balanced by a drop in pressure or a pressure gradient force.	
	 Weissenberg Effect		A phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is placed into a solution of liquid polymer. Instead of being thrown outward, entanglements cause the polymer chains to be drawn towards the rod. 	
	 Wetting		The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.	
	 Wind		The flow of air or other gases that compose an atmosphere 	
	 Abrasion		The process of scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, or rubbing away. It can be intentionally imposed in a controlled process using an abrasive. 	By removal of dirt or other unwanted material by abrasion.
	 Amphiphiles		A chemical compound possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Common amphiphilic substances are soap and detergent.	
	 Capillary Action		(capillarity, capillary motion, wicking) The movement of a liquid relative to a substance in contact. A result of the adhesive intermolecular forces between the liquid and the substance being stronger (or weaker)  than the cohesive intermolecular forces inside the liquid. Causes a concave (or concave) meniscus to form where the liquid touches the surface. Can cause raising or lowering (e.g. mercury in glass) of the liquid.	By removing an unwanted liquid from a solid.
	 Deflagration		A technical term describing subsonic combustion that usually propagates through thermal conductivity (hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it). Most 'fire' found in daily life, from flames to explosions, is technically deflagration. Deflagration is different from detonation (which is supersonic and propagates through shock compression).	By burning off unwanted material.
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	By attracting unwanted material away from material to be cleaned, or vice versa.
	 Hydrophile		A physical property of a molecule that can transiently bond with water (H2O) through hydrogen bonding. This is thermodynamically favorable, and makes these molecules soluble not only in water, but also in other polar solvents.	Soap has a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, which allows it to dissolve in both waters and oils, therefore allowing the soap to clean a surface.
	 Hydrophobe		The physical property of a molecule (known as a hydrophobe) that is repelled from a mass of water. Hydrophobic molecules tend to be non-polar and thus prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents. Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together forming micelles. Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle.	For example, the lotus leaf effect.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	For example, removing ferromagnetic metal contaminants
	 Plasma		A partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter.	Plasma cleaning involves the removal of impurities and contaminants from surfaces through the use of an energetic plasma created from gaseous species.
	 Sputtering		A process whereby atoms are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment of the target by energetic ions. It is commonly used for thin-film deposition, etching and analytical techniques	Ion Beam Sputtering can be used to  polish telescope mirrors.
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. Additionally, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties to be 'tuned'.	Supercritical Fluids (such as supercritical carbon dioxide) are used a cleaning solvenets - for example in dry-cleaning.
	 Triboelectric Effect		A type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into contact with another different material and are then separated (such as through rubbing). The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.	By attracting dirt particles away from the object to be cleaned
	 Ultrasonic Vibration		Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.	Ultrasonic cleaners are used at frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments, diving regulators and industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works mostly by energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic cavitations near the dirty surface  forming tiny jets directed at the surface.
	 Vacuum		A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum.	Through evaporation of sufficiently volatile contaminants.
	 Condensation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter from gaseous phase into liquid phase.	By chaging the gas to the liquid phase it may be less vulnerable than when in the gas phase.
	 Cryogenics		The behavior of materials at very low temperatures (typically below -150 °C, -238 °F or 123 K).	
	 Deposition (physical)		A process in which gas transforms into solid (also known as desublimation). The reverse of deposition is sublimation. One example of deposition is the process by which, in sub-freezing air, water vapour changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid. This is how snow forms in clouds, as well as frost and hoar frost on the ground.	By depositing the gas as a solid, it may be less vulnerable than when in the gas phase.
	 Physical Containment		Partial or complete enclosure of an object or substance by some physical medium, typically for the purpose of protection or restriction of movement.	
	 Porosity		The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.	By absorbing the gas into a porous material.
	 Supercooling		(also known as undercooling) The process of lowering the temperature of a liquid or a gas below its freezing point, without it becoming a solid. A liquid below its standard freezing point will crystallize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form. Without any such nucleus, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.	
	 Supersaturation		A solution that contains more of the dissolved material than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal circumstances. It can also refer to a vapour of a compound that has a higher (partial) pressure than the vapour pressure of that compound.	
	 Suspension		A heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid - which may be liquid or gas) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. 	
	 Conduction (electrical)		The movement of electrically charged particles through a transmission medium (electrical conductor). The movement of charge constitutes an electric current. The charge transport may result as a response to an electric field, or as a result of a concentration gradient in carrier density, that is, by diffusion . 	
	 Deformation		A change in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force. This can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive (pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting). Deformation is often described in terms of strain. 	
	 Depressurisation		Reduction in pressure. Rapid depressurisation can be used to create pressure differences.	For example, sunflower seeds are broken open by subjecting them to a high pressure followed by rapid depressurisation. The resulting pressure difference breaks open the husks.
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	Through inductive heating.
	 Electromagnetic Induction		The generation of electromotive force (EMF) in a current-carrying conductor exposed to a changing magnetic field	Through inductive heating.
	 Fatigue		The progressive and localised structural damage that occurs when a material is subjected to cyclic loading. The maximum stress values are less than the ultimate tensile stress limit, and may be below the yield stress limit of the material.	
	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.	For example, frost damage in the case of water which has a negative coeficcient of thermal expansion at temperatures below 4 °C.
	 Hydrolysis		A chemical reaction during which one or more water molecules are split into hydrogen and hydroxide ions which may go on to participate in further reactions.	
	 Light		Light is electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye (in a range from about 380 or 400 nanometres to about 760 or 780 nm)	Using a high-power light source or a target susceptible to light.
	 Pressure Drop		Pressure is an effect which occurs when a force is applied on a surface. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid normal to these boundaries or sections at every point. Rapid pressure drop is a useful technique for applying force or breaking objects apart.	For example, the breaking apart of sunflower seed shells by sudden pressure drop.
	 Regelation		The phenomenon of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. Occurs only for substances, such as ice, that have the property of expanding upon freezing, for the melting points of those substances decrease with increasing external pressure.	
	 Sputtering		A process whereby atoms are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment of the target by energetic ions. It is commonly used for thin-film deposition, etching and analytical techniques	
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. Additionally, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties to be 'tuned'.	For example: Carbon dioxide is a common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction of hops for beer production.
	 Tension		The pulling force exerted by a string, cable, chain, or similar object on another object. It is the opposite of compression.	
	 Thermionic Emission		Emission of electrons or ions caused by thermal vibrational energy . Also known as the Edison Effect.	
	 Torque		Torque (also called moment or moment of force) is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist. Torque is the rotational analogue of Force.	
	 X-Ray		A form of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3 × 1016 Hz to 3 × 1019 Hz) and energies in the range 120 eV to 120 keV. They are shorter in wavelength than UV rays and longer than gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is called Röntgen radiation.	
	 Bingham Plastic		A viscoplastic material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high stress. A common example is toothpaste, which will not be extruded until a certain pressure is applied to the tube. It then is pushed out as a solid plug.	
	 Cohesion		The action or property of like molecules sticking together, being mutually attractive. This is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules which makes the distribution of orbiting electrons irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a macroscopic structure such as a water drop.	
	 Condensation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter from gaseous phase into liquid phase.	
	 Groove		A long and narrow indentation built into a material, generally for the purpose of allowing another material or part to move within the groove and be guided by it. 	
	 Photophoresis		The phenomenon that small particles suspended in gas (aerosols) or liquids (hydrocolloids) starts to migrate when illuminated by a sufficiently intense beam of light. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a fluid medium.	
	 Potential Well		The region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy held in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well and so may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy.	
	 Thermophoresis		(also called thermodiffusion or Soret Effect) The effect of temperature gradient on multicomponent (or isotopic) mixtures of particles (i.e. particle movement from hotter to colder regions or vice versa). Regarded as 'positive' when molecules move from hot to cold and 'negative' when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibits positive behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative.	A thermal precipitator is an instrument that collects aerosol particles using thermophoresis to deposit the particles onto a surface. It employs a heated element, such as a wire, and a collection surface. Aerosol passing between the heated element and the cooler surface will be driven to deposit on the surface.
	 Angle of Repose		(or critical angle of repose) The minimum angle made by the inclined plane with the horizontal surface such that the body lying on the inclined plane is just at the verge of sliding down along the inclined plane. When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material. 	
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	
	 Coulomb's Law		The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.	
	 Drag		A drag (sometimes called fluid resistance) is the force that resists the movement of a solid object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). The most familiar form of drag is made up of friction forces, which act parallel to the object's surface, plus pressure forces, which act in a direction perpendicular to the object's surface.	
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	
	 Electric Field		The space surrounding an electric charge or in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field has a property called an electric field (that can also be equated to electric flux density). This electric field exerts a force on other electrically charged objects. 	
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	
	 Helix		A special kind of space curve, i.e. a smooth curve in three-space. A helix is characterised by the fact that the tangent line at any point makes a constant angle with a fixed line.	
	 Latent Heat		Energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process. An example is a state of matter change, meaning a phase transition, such as ice melting or water boiling.	Through heating and subsequent evaporation.
	 Lotus Leaf Effect		The leaves of the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo) are characterized by a very high water repellency (superhydrophobicity). Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to a complex micro- and nanoscopic architecture of the surface which enables minimisation of adhesion.	Solid particles are carried by the water droplets.
	 Nuclear Fusion		The generation of power by the fusing together of atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.	
	 Pressure Gradient		A fluid (gas or liquid) subject to a pressure gradient results in a net force that is directed from high to low pressure (the 'pressure gradient force'). 	In the case of a divided solid dispersed in a fluid.
	 Rayleigh-Bénard Convection		Convection cells that appear spontaneously in a liquid layer when heat is applied from below. 	For a divided solid dispersed in a fluid.
	 Sedimentation		The motion of molecules in solutions or particles in suspensions in response to an external force such as gravity, centrifugal acceleration or electromagnetism. Sedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from suspensions of dust and pollen particles to cellular suspensions to solutions of single molecules such as proteins and peptides. 	
	 Tidal Force		A situation in which a body or material (for example, tidal water, or the Moon) is mainly under the gravitational influence of a second body (for example, the Earth), but is also perturbed by the gravitational effects of a third body (for example, by the Moon in the case of tidal water, or by the Sun in the case of the Moon).	In the case of a divided solid floating on or suspended in a fluid subject to tidal flow.
	 Triboelectric Effect		A type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into contact with another different material and are then separated (such as through rubbing). The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.	For example, the attraction of particles to an object carrying a staic electric charge generated by the Triboelectric Effect
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	For example, using activated carbon to remove potentially harmful contaminants from water.
	 Antibubble		A droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a thin film of liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water (e.g. water globules), or be completely submerged in the liquid to which they are directed.	
	 Coagulation		A complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel) whereby a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel.	
	 Density Gradient		Variation of density across an area or through a volume.	For example, layers of water with differing salinity having different density.
	 Leidenfrost Effect		A phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapour layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. Due to this repulsive force, the droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. Commonly seen in the case of droplets of water skittering across a very hot metal surface.	The liquid (well, most of it!)  is insulated from the hot surface
	 Non-Newtonian Fluids		Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined. A ratio between shear stress and rate of strain (or shear-dependent viscosity) can be defined, this being more useful for fluids without time-dependent behavior.	
	 Porosity		The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.	By absorbing the liquid into a porous material.
	 Rheopecty		(or rheopexy) The rare property of some non-Newtonian fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken (the opposite type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy and is much more common).	
	 Shear Thickening		(or Dilitant) The property of a material for which viscosity increases with the rate of shear. Such a shear thickening fluid is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid.	
	 Superheating		(sometimes referred to as boiling retardation, or boiling delay) The phenomenon in which a liquid is heated to a temperature higher than its boiling point, without boiling. Superheating is achieved by heating a homogeneous substance in a clean container, free of nucleation sites, while taking care not to disturb the liquid.	
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	By adsorping contaminants.
	 Acousto-optic Effect		A specific case of photoelasticity, where there is a change of a material's permittivity due to a mechanical strain resulting from an acoustic wave which has been excited within a transparent medium giving rise to variation of the refractive index. This creates a diffraction grating moving with the velocity given by the spread on the sound wave in the medium which defracts light forming a prominent diffraction pattern. 	
	 Auxetic Materials		Materials which, when stretched, become thicker perpendicularly to the applied force, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials  have interesting mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance. This may be useful in applications such as body armor, packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material and sponge mops.	For example, a pressure field.
	 Birefringence		Birefringence, or double refraction, is the decomposition of a ray of light into two rays (the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray) when it passes through certain types of material, such as calcite crystals or boron nitride, depending on the polarisation of the light. This effect can occur only if the structure of the material is anisotropic (directionally dependent).	
	 Bragg Diffraction		Diffraction from a three dimensional periodic structure such as atoms in a crystal. It is similar to what occurs when waves are scattered from a diffraction grating. Bragg diffraction is a consequence of interference between waves reflecting from different crystal planes.	
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	By acting as a lens.
	 Conduction (electrical)		The movement of electrically charged particles through a transmission medium (electrical conductor). The movement of charge constitutes an electric current. The charge transport may result as a response to an electric field, or as a result of a concentration gradient in carrier density, that is, by diffusion . 	Electric current can be directed through conductors of any shape.
	 Creeping Wave		When a wave front passes an obstruction, it spreads out into the shadowed space. A creeping wave, in electromagnetism or acoustics is the wave that is diffracted around the shadowed surface of a smooth body such as a sphere.	
	 Diffraction		Various phenomena which occur when a wave encounters an obstacle. It is described as the apparent bending of waves around small obstacles and the spreading out of waves past small openings. Very similar effects are observed when there is an alteration in the properties of the medium in which the wave is travelling, for example a variation in refractive index for light waves or in acoustic impedance for sound waves and these can also be referred to as diffraction effects.	
	 Dispersion (of waves)		In optics, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency. Media having such a property are termed dispersive media. Dispersion is most often described for light waves, but it may occur for any kind of wave that interacts with a medium or passes through an inhomogeneous geometry (e.g. a waveguide), such as sound waves.	
	 Electro-Optic Effects		"A change in the optical properties of a material in response to an electric field that varies slowly compared with the frequency of light. The term encompasses a number of distinct phenomena, which can be subdivided into a) change of the absorption (electroabsorption, Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-confined Stark effect, electro-chromatic effect) and b) change of the refractive index(Pockels effect, Kerr Effect, electro-gyration)
"	
	 Faraday Effect		An interaction between light and a magnetic field in a dielectric material. The rotation of the plane of polarisation is proportional to the intensity of the component of the magnetic field in the direction of the beam of light.	
	 Fresnel Diffraction		(or near-field diffraction) A process of diffraction which occurs when a wave passes through an aperture and diffracts in the near field, causing any diffraction pattern observed to differ in size and shape, depending on the distance between the aperture and the projection. It occurs due to the short distance in which the diffracted waves propagate. When the distance is increased, outgoing diffracted waves become planar and Fraunhofer diffraction occurs.	
	 Gravitational Lensing		A gravitational lens is formed when the light from a very distant, bright source (such as a quasar) is 'bent' around a massive object (such as a cluster of galaxies) between the source object and the observer. The process is known as gravitational lensing, and is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.	
	 Holes		A hole is a confined lack of structure in some part of an object.	By diffraction
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.	For example, using a diffraction grating.
	 Kerr Effect		(or the quadratic electro-optic effect) A change in the refractive index of a material in response to an electric field. Distinct from the Pockels effect in that the induced index change is directly proportional to the square of the electric field instead of to the magnitude of the field. All materials show a Kerr effect, but certain liquids display the effect more strongly than other materials.	
	 Liquid Crystals		Substances that exhibit a phase of matter that has properties between those of a conventional liquid, and those of a solid crystal. 	
	 Magnetic Reluctance		Analogous to the way an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance.	
	 Mirage (photothermal deflection)		A naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. 	
	 Negative Refraction		An electromagnetic phenomenon where light rays are refracted at an interface in the reverse sense to that normally expected. Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive phase velocity (i.e. a positive refractive index), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (refractive index).	
	 Pockels Effect		Produces birefringence in an optical medium induced by a constant or varying electric field. Used to make Pockels cells, which are voltage-controlled wave plates.	
	 Reflection		The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves. 	
	 Refraction		The change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed. This is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 90° or 0°. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but any type of wave can refract when it interacts with a medium, for example when sound waves pass from one medium into another or when water waves move into water of a different depth. 	
	 Scattering		A general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass (includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection).	
	 Temperature Gradient		The variation in temperature over distance.	For example by creating a 'lens' based on variations in density due to termperature.
	 Total Internal Reflection		An optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary, no light can pass through and all of the light is reflected. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.	
	 Turbulence		A fluid regime characterised by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time (flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow).	Though turbulence in the medium carrying the field.
	 Voigt Effect		A magneto-optical phenomenon whereby the polarisation of light may be rotated when passed through a vapour cell immersed in a magnetic field directed perpendicular to the beam direction.	
	 Acoustic Cavitation		Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse.  High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries.	Cavitating water purification devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. 
	 Flocculation		A process of contact and adhesion whereby the particles of a dispersion form larger-size clusters.	
	 Deposition (physical)		A process in which gas transforms into solid (also known as desublimation). The reverse of deposition is sublimation. One example of deposition is the process by which, in sub-freezing air, water vapour changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid. This is how snow forms in clouds, as well as frost and hoar frost on the ground.	
	 Adiabatic Heating		Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g. a piston. Diesel engines rely on adiabatic heating during their compression stroke to elevate the temperature sufficiently to ignite the fuel.	
	 Adiabatic Cooling		Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure of a substance is decreased as it does work on its surroundings. Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid.	
	 Capillary Evaporation		The transport of a liquid from within a capillary system (e.g. a block of porous material) and the subsequent evaporation from its surface.	By lowering temperature through latent heat of evaporation
	 Conduction (thermal)		The spontaneous transfer of thermal energy through matter, from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Conduction acts to equalize temperature differences. It is also described as heat energy transferred from one material to another by direct contact.	
	 Cooling		The act of reducing temperature.	
	 Electrocaloric Effect		A phenomenon in which a material shows a reversible temperature change under an applied electric field. Often considered the physical inverse of the pyroelectric effect. The effect comes from the voltage raising or lowering the entropy of the system. Analogous to the magnetocaloric effect.	
	 Endothermic Reaction		A process or reaction that absorbs energy typically (but not always) in the form of heat. The concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to e.g. chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.	
	 Evaporation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter from  liquid phase to gaseous phase. 	By lowering temperature through latent heat of evaporation
	 Joule-Thomson Effect		The temperature change of a gas resulting from expansion without production of work or the transfer of heat. For example, when a gas or liquid is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulated.	
	 Magnetocaloric Effect		(or Magnetothermal Effect) A magneto-thermodynamic phenomenon in which a reversible change in temperature of a suitable material is caused by exposing the material to a changing magnetic field. Also known as adiabatic demagnetisation. Can be used to attain extremely low temperatures (well below 1 K), as well as the ranges used in common refrigerators.	
	 Melting		A process that results in the phase change of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a solid substance is increased (typically by the absorbtion of heat) to a specific temperature (called the melting point) at which it changes to the liquid phase. 	Melting is endothermic. The energy absorbed by the melting of one substance may result in the freezing another.
	 Peltier Effect		Heat is evolved or absorbed at the junction of two dissimilar metals carrying a small current, depending upon the direction of the current. One of a number of thermoelectric effects (See Seebeck Effect and Thompson Effect).	Through cooling of the liquid
	 Phase Change		The transformation of a thermodynamic system from one phase to another. Most commonly used to describe transitions between solid, liquid and gaseous states of matter, in rare cases including plasma.	Phase Changes are exothermic or endothermic and can be used to trigger other phase changes.
	 Precipitation		The formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction or by diffusion in a solid.	
	 Pressurisation		The application of pressure in a given situation or environment; and more specifically refers to the process by which atmospheric pressure is maintained in an isolated or semi-isolated atmospheric environment (for instance, in an aircraft, or whilst scuba diving).	
	 Radiation		A process in which energetic particles or waves travel through a medium or space. There are two distinct types of radiation; ionizing and non-ionizing. 	Through cooling of the radiating Liquid.
	 Ranque-Hilsch Effect		The Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube (or vortex tube), is a mechanical device that separates a compressed gas into hot and cold streams. It has no moving parts. Pressurised gas is injected tangentially into a swirl chamber and accelerates to a high rate of rotation. Due to the conical nozzle at the end of the tube, only the outer shell of the compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.	
	 Thermal Hall Effect		The thermal analog of the Hall effect, i.e. a thermal gradient is produced across a solid instead of an electric field. When a magnetic field is applied, an orthogonal temperature gradient develops. For conductors, a significant portion of the thermal current is carried by the electrons. In particular, the Righi-Leduc Effect describes the heat flow resulting from a perpendicular temperature gradient and vice versa, and the Maggi-Righi-Leduc effect describes changes in thermal conductivity when placing a conductor in a magnetic field.	
	 Thermal Radiation		Electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an object due to the object's temperature.	A hot liquid (e.g. molten metal)  cools as a result of the loss of energy required to generate the thermal radiation
	 Thompson Effect		The heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient Depending on the material it may cause heating or cooling. One of a number of thermoelectirc effects (see Seebeck effect and Peltier Effect).	
	 London Dispersion Force		A weak intermolecular force acting between atoms and molecules arising from quantum induced instantaneous polarisation multipoles in molecules. Can therefore act between molecules without permanent multipole moments.	
	 Magnetohydrodynamic Effect		A magnetic field can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which create forces on the fluid, and also change the magnetic field itself.	MHD is used in plasma confinement.
	 Van der Waals Force		The sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules (or between parts of the same molecule) other than those due to covalent bonds or to the electrostatic interaction of ions with one another or with neutral molecules. Includes Keesom Force, Debye Force and London dispersion force.	
	 Avalanche Breakdown		A phenomenon that can occur in both insulating and semiconducting materials (solids, liquids, or gases), allowing very large currents to flow within materials which are otherwise good insulators. Occurs when the electric field in the material is great enough to accelerate free electrons to the point that, when they strike atoms in the material, they can knock other electrons free: the number of free electrons is thus increased rapidly as newly generated particles become part of the process.	
	 Electrorheological Effect		Electrorheological (ER) fluids are suspensions of extremely fine non-conducting particles (up to 50 micrometres diameter) in an electrically insulating fluid. The apparent viscosity of ER fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an electric field. A typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a liquid to that of a gel, and back, with response times of the order of ms. Sometimes called the Winslow Effect.	In the sense of a large change in apparent viscosity (a loose interpretation of Phase Change).
	 Fermentation		In an industrial context, fermentation refers to the breakdown of organic substances and re-assembly into other substances. Somewhat paradoxically, fermenter culture in industrial capacity often refers to highly oxygenated and aerobic growth conditions, whereas fermentation in the biochemical context is a strictly anaerobic process.	Not a phase change in the strict sense of the term, but nonetheless a way of transforming a solid into a liquid or gas.
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	In the sense that solid particles can be manipulated as if they were liquid (even though, strictly speaking, a phase change has not taken place)
	 Gel		A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).	In the sense that a soild component of a gel behaves somewhat like a liquid.
	 Hydrophile		A physical property of a molecule that can transiently bond with water (H2O) through hydrogen bonding. This is thermodynamically favorable, and makes these molecules soluble not only in water, but also in other polar solvents.	In the sense that it can transform it so as to become soluble in a liquid.
	 Suspension		A heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid - which may be liquid or gas) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. 	In the sense that a suspension (which is partially solid) behaves in many respects as a liquid.
	 Viscoelasticity		The property of exhibiting both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. 	
	 Added Mass		(or Virtual Mass) The inertia added to a system because an accelerating or decelerating body must move (or deflect) some volume of surrounding fluid as it moves through it.	
	 Auger Effect		When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of energy. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted photon, in the case of the Auger Effect,  the energy is instead transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. 	Auger electron spectroscopy involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with X-rays or energetic electrons and measuring  the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment.
	 Basset Force		The force due to the lagging boundary layer development with changing relative velocity (acceleration) of bodies moving through a fluid.	
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	Bubbles can be observed optically - their presence or movement can indicate the presence of a gas or a moving gas stream.
	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor. 	Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. 
	 Capillary Condensation		The process by which multilayer adsorption from the vapour phase into a porous medium proceeds to the point at which pore spaces become filled with condensed liquid from the vapour phase. The unique aspect of capillary condensation is that vapor condensation occurs below the saturation vapor pressure of the pure liquid.  Can affect contact between solids, modifying macroscopic adhesion & friction properties.	By detecting condensed gas within the capillary system.
	 Dielectric Permittivity		The measure of how much resistance is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an electric field affects, and is affected by, a dielectric medium. Permittivity is determined by the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to transmit (or 'permit') an electric field.	The presence of a material will affect the amount of electric flux produced in response to an electric charge.
	 Doppler Effect		The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium.	For example, a moving gaseous medium will result in a doppler shift in a sound wave propagating through it. 
	 Drag		A drag (sometimes called fluid resistance) is the force that resists the movement of a solid object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). The most familiar form of drag is made up of friction forces, which act parallel to the object's surface, plus pressure forces, which act in a direction perpendicular to the object's surface.	By measuring the drag force on an object moving relative to the gas.
	 Echo		A reflection of sound, arriving at the listener some time after the direct sound. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source. The time delay is the extra distance divided by the speed of sound.	The speed of a returning echo will be affected by the presence of a gas.
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	Gas ions can be attracted by the charge of an electret. Electrets are used in radon gas detectors.
	 Electric Spark		A type of electrostatic discharge that occurs when an electric field creates an ionized electrically conductive channel in air producing a brief emission of light and sound. A spark is formed when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric field strength of air. This causes an increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to become an electrical conductor through dielectric breakdown.	Without a gas to ionise, no conductive path can be established.
	 Electrical Resistance		The degree to which an object opposes an electric current flowing through it (usually measured in Ohms). A function of both its physical geometry and the resistivity of the material the object is made from.	
	 Electrohydrodynamics		Includes the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms:Electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.	
	 Electrolysis		A method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes. 	For a gaseous electrolyte. The passage of current, or presence of the products of electrolysis signals the presence of the gas.
	 Electron Paramagnetic Resonance		(EPR) or electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a technique for studying chemical species that have one or more unpaired electrons, such as organic and inorganic free radicals or inorganic complexes possessing a transition metal ion. The basic physical concepts of EPR are analogous to those of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of spins of atomic nuclei	
	 Fluorescence		Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of a photon triggers the emission of a photon with a longer (less energetic) wavelength. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as molecular rotations, vibrations or heat. Sometimes the absorbed photon is in the ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range.	By doping or otherwise attaching a flourescent component to the substance or object to be detected and then exposing it to appropriate radiation (e.g. security pen and UV light)

	 Hot Chocolate Effect		The pitch heard from tapping a cup of hot liquid rises after addition of a soluble powder. May be observed by stirring chocolate powder into a mug of hot milk, tapping bottom of mug with a spoon while milk is in motion. Pitch of the taps will increase progressively. Subsequent stirring decreases the pitch. Due to the effect of bubble density on the speed of sound in the liquid. The note heard is the frequency of standing wave with fixed wavelength of liquid column height.	Entrained gas bubbles reduce the speed of sound in the liquid, lowering the frequency. As the bubbles clear, sound travels faster in the liquid and the frequency increases.

The nature of the vortcies will depend upon the viscosity of the fluid.
	 Metastability		A general scientific concept which describes states of delicate equilibrium. A system is in a metastable state when it is in equilibrium (not changing with time) but is susceptible to fall into lower-energy states with only slight interaction. It is analogous to being at the bottom of a small valley when there is a deeper valley close by	The 'tipping' of a metastable system into a lower energy state in response to a small stimulus could be used to make a senstive detector.
	 Nucleation		The extremely localised budding of a distinct thermodynamic phase. Some examples of phases that may form via nucleation in liquids are gaseous bubbles, crystals or glassy regions. Creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor is also characterized by nucleation. Most nucleation processes are physical, rather than chemical, but a few exceptions do exist (e.g. electrochemical nucleation). 	For example, through preferential nucleation of the gas on (or near) a detector.

Characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Associated with rapid rise in pressure, temperature and density of the flow. A shock wave travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave.	By detection of the shock wave produduced by a fast moving gas.
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid.

Using Supercritical fluid chromatography.
	 Surface Acoustic Wave		(SAW) An acoustic wave traveling along the surface of a material having some elasticity, with an amplitude that typically decays exponentially with the depth of the substrate. This kind of wave is commonly used in devices called SAW devices in electronics circuits. 	SAWs have a longitudinal and a vertical shear component that can couple with any media in contact with the surface. This coupling strongly affects the amplitude and velocity of the wave, allowing SAW sensors to directly sense mass and mechanical properties.
	 Terminal Velocity		A free falling object achieves its terminal velocity when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag.

	 Turbulence		A fluid regime characterised by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time (flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow).	By observing resulting turbulence around an existing solid object.

This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	For example, by fluidising using hot air or liquid.
	 Fluorescence		Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of a photon triggers the emission of a photon with a longer (less energetic) wavelength.

	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.	Freezing is an exothermic process.
	 Impact Force		A high force or shock applied over a short time period. Such a force or acceleration can sometimes have a greater effect than a lower force applied over a proportionally longer time period.	During an impact, some of the mechanical energy is converted to heat.

Most commonly used to describe transitions between solid, liquid and gaseous states of matter, in rare cases including plasma.	Condensation (gas to liquid) or fusion (liquid to solid) are exothermic phase changes
	 Piezomagnetism		A phenomenon observed in some antiferromagnetic crystals. It is characterised by a linear coupling between the system's magnetic polarisation and mechanical strain. In a piezomagnetic, one may induce a spontaneous magnetic moment by applying physical stress, or a physical deformation by applying a magnetic field. Piezomagnetism differs from the related property of magnetostriction.	
	 Porosity		The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.	By passing a hot liquid or gas through a porous solid.
	 Righi-Leduc Effect		A magnetic field applied at right angles to the the direction of a temperature gradient in an electrical conductor will produce a temperature difference at right angles to the direction of both the temperature gradient and the magnetic field.	
	 Second Sound		A quantum mechanical phenomenon in which heat transfer occurs by wave-like motion, rather than by the more usual mechanism of diffusion. Heat takes the place of pressure in normal sound waves. This leads to a very high thermal conductivity. It is known as 'second sound' because the wave motion of heat is similar to the propagation of sound in air.	
	 Shear Stress		A stress which is applied parallel or tangential to a face of a material, as opposed to a normal stress which is applied perpendicularly.	
	 Solvation		(commonly called dissolution) The process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute.

	 Thermolysis		(or Thermal decomposition)  A chemical decomposition caused by heat. The reaction is usually endothermic as heat is required to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition. If decomposition is sufficiently exothermic, a positive feedback loop is created producing thermal runaway and possibly an explosion.	In the case of exothermic decomposition.
	 Wear		The erosion of material from a solid surface by the action of another surface.	Heat is typically a bi-product of wear.
	 Wiedemann Effect		A magnetoelastic effect. The twisting of a magnetic material when a helical magnetic field is applied to it.	As a result of frictional heating.
	 Wiegand Effect		Generation of electrical pulses when a specially processed wire is moved in a magnetic field. The wire has two distinct magnetic regions that react differently to the magnetic field: the shell requires a strong magnetic field to reverse its magnetic polarity, whereas the core will revert under weaker field conditions. The polarity of the wire shifts very rapidly, generating strong, short (~10 µs) electrical pulses without additional external power. 	Through ohmic heating of the wire
	 Acousto-optic Effect		A specific case of photoelasticity, where there is a change of a material's permittivity due to a mechanical strain resulting from an acoustic wave which has been excited within a transparent medium giving rise to variation of the refractive index. This creates a diffraction grating moving with the velocity given by the spread on the sound wave in the medium which defracts light forming a prominent diffraction pattern. 	Through Bragg cell deflection into an absorbent region
	 Aerosol		A suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas. 	For example, an aerosol of liquid droplets in air can be used to absorb or attenuate radiation, such as light.
	 Auxetic Materials		Materials which, when stretched, become thicker perpendicularly to the applied force, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials  have interesting mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance. This may be useful in applications such as body armor, packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material and sponge mops.	Though the use of energy to 'power' the auxetic change.
	 Boiling		A type of phase transition. The rapid vaporisation of a liquid, which typically occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure.	The phase change associated with boiling requires the use of energy.
	 Brewster's Angle		Brewster's angle (also known as the polarisation angle) is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarisation is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarised light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarised.	For example, polarised sunglasses use the principle of Brewster's angle to reduce glare from the sun reflecting off horizontal surfaces such as water or road.
	 Chemical Bonding		The physical process responsible for the attractive interactions between atoms and molecules, and which confers stability to diatomic and polyatomic chemical compounds. In general, chemical bonding is associated with the sharing of electrons between the participating atoms. Molecules, crystals, and diatomic gases and most of the physical environment around us are held together by chemical bonds.	The forming of chemical bonds generally requires energy.
	 Curie Point (ferromagnetic)		The Curie point of a ferromagnetic material is the temperature above which it loses its characteristic ferromagnetic ability 	Energy is required for the state change at the curie point.
	 Curie Point (piezoelectric)		The Curie point of a piezoelectric material is the temperature above which the material loses its spontaneous polarisation and piezoelectric characteristics	Energy is required for the state change at the curie point.
	 Damping		Damping is any effect, either deliberately engendered or inherent to a system, that tends to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of an oscillatory system.	
	 Deformation		A change in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force. This can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive (pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting). Deformation is often described in terms of strain. 	Energy is required to deform an object.
	 Dellinger Effect		A fadeout of short-wave radios, caused by increased ionization of the D region of the ionosphere due to solar flares.	
	 Dielectric Permittivity		The measure of how much resistance is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an electric field affects, and is affected by, a dielectric medium. Permittivity is determined by the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to transmit (or 'permit') an electric field.	In the case of an electric field.
	 Echo		A reflection of sound, arriving at the listener some time after the direct sound. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source. The time delay is the extra distance divided by the speed of sound.	
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	Eddy Currents produce a magnetic field opposite to that inducing the eddy current.
	 Elasticity		The physical property of a material when it deforms under stress (e.g. external forces), but returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. The amount of deformation is called the strain. The elastic regime is characterized by a linear relationship between stress and strain, denoted linear elasticity. 	
	 Electrochromism		A type of electro-optic effect. The creation of an absorption band at some wavelengths in a material in response to an electric field, which gives rise to a change in colour (i.e. the phenomenon displayed by some chemical species of reversibly changing color when a burst of charge is applied).	
	 Electromagnetic Induction		The generation of electromotive force (EMF) in a current-carrying conductor exposed to a changing magnetic field	Eddy Currents produce a magnetic field opposite to that inducing the eddy current.

The apparent viscosity of ER fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an electric field. A typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a liquid to that of a gel, and back, with response times of the order of ms. Sometimes called the Winslow Effect.	It has been proposed to create bullet-proof vests using an ER fluid because the ability to soak the fluid into cloth creates the potential for a very light vest that can change from a normal cloth into a hard covering almost instantaneously
	 Electrostriction		"A property of all electrical non-conductors, or dielectrics, that causes them to change their shape under the application of an electric field. All dielectrics exhibit some electrostriction, but certain engineered ceramics, known as relaxor ferroelectrics, have extraordinarily high electrostrictive constants,e.g. Lead magnesium niobate (PMN), Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT), Lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT).
"	
	 Electroviscous Effect		Change in a liquid's viscosity induced by a strong electrostatic field.

By using the energy of the field to enable an endothermic reation.
	 Franz-Keldysh Effect		A change in optical absorption by a semiconductor when an electric field is applied. Used to create electroabsorption modulators.	An electroabsorption modulator can be used for modulating the intensity of a laser beam via an electric voltage. Its principle of operation is based on the Franz-Keldysh effect.
	 Harmonic Oscillator		A system which, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force proportional to the displacement. Mechanical examples include pendula (with small angles of displacement) and masses connected to springs.	
	 Hooke's Law		Hooke's law of elasticity is an approximation that states that the extension of a spring is in direct proportion with the load added to it as long as this load does not exceed the elastic limit. Materials for which Hooke's law is a useful approximation are known as linear-elastic or 'Hookean' materials.	
	 Latent Heat		Energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process. An example is a state of matter change, meaning a phase transition, such as ice melting or water boiling.	For example, using ice to absorb the heat from a drink.

	 Non-Newtonian Fluids		Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined. A ratio between shear stress and rate of strain (or shear-dependent viscosity) can be defined, this being more useful for fluids without time-dependent behavior.	For example, mechanical force, in the case of body armour.
	 Peltier Effect		Heat is evolved or absorbed at the junction of two dissimilar metals carrying a small current, depending upon the direction of the current. One of a number of thermoelectric effects (See Seebeck Effect and Thompson Effect).	Either by absorbing a thermal field, or by absorbing the electrical field used to power the Peltier effect.
	 Phosphorescence		A specific type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence. Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately re-emit the radiation it absorbs. 	
	 Photochromism		The reversible transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, where the two forms have different absorption spectra. Trivially, this can be described as a reversible change of colour upon exposure to light.	
	 Photovoltaic Effect		The creation of a voltage (or a corresponding electric current) in a material upon exposure to light. Though directly related to the photoelectric effect, the two processes are different and should be distinguished. In the photoelectric effect, electrons are ejected from a material's surface upon exposure to radiation of sufficient energy. The photovoltaic effect is different in that the generated electrons are transferred between different bands (i.e. from the valence to conduction bands) within the material, resulting in the buildup of a voltage between two electrodes.	
	 Poisson's Effect		When a material is compressed in one direction, it usually tends to expand in the other two directions perpendicular to the direction of compression.	
	 Pyroelectric Effect		The ability of certain materials to generate an electrical potential when they are heated or cooled. As a result of this change in temperature, positive and negative charges move to opposite ends through migration (i.e. the material becomes polarized) and hence, an electrical potential is established.	
	 Rayleigh Scattering		The elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light.	
	 Reverberation		The persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is removed. A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air.This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they can no longer be heard.	
	 Rheopecty		(or rheopexy) The rare property of some non-Newtonian fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken (the opposite type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy and is much more common).	For example, mechanical force, in the case of body armour.
	 Shadow		An area where direct light (or other radiation) from a source cannot reach due to obstruction by an object. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or reverse projection of the object blocking the light (or radiation).	
	 Shear Thickening		(or Dilitant) The property of a material for which viscosity increases with the rate of shear. Such a shear thickening fluid is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid.	For example, mechanical force, in the case of body armour.
	 Skin Effect		The tendency of an alternating electric current (AC) to distribute itself within a conductor so that the current density near the surface of the conductor is greater than that at its core. That is, the electric current tends to flow at the 'skin' of the conductor. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor to increase with the frequency of the current. Skin effect is due to eddy currents set up by the AC current.	
	 Static Friction		(or Stiction) Two solid objects pressing against each other (but not sliding) will require some threshold of force parallel to the surface of contact in order to overcome static cohesion. Static Friction is a threshold, not a continuous force.	
	 Stick-slip Phenomenon		The spontaneous jerking motion that can occur while two objects are sliding over each other.	
	 Stress Relaxation		The decrease in stress with time in a viscoelatic material held at constant strain or deformation.	
	 Terminal Velocity		A free falling object achieves its terminal velocity when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag. This causes the net force on the object to be zero, resulting in an acceleration of zero. Mathematically an object asymptotically approaches and can never reach its terminal velocity.	
	 Thermochromism		The ability of substance to change color due to a change in temperature. Thermochromism is one of several types of chromism. The two basic approaches are based on liquid crystals and leuco dyes.	
	 Velocity Ratio		In a machine, the ratio between the distance moved by the point of effort to that of the point of load.	
	 Electrodeposition		The process of using electrical current to reduce cations of a desired material from a solution and coat a conductive object with a thin layer of the material, such as a metal. Primarily used for depositing a layer of material to bestow a desired property (e.g., abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection, lubricity, aesthetic qualities, etc.) to a surface that otherwise lacks that property. Another application uses electroplating to build up thickness on undersized parts.	
	 Fractal Forms		A fractal is generally 'a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole,' a property called self-similarity. A mathematical fractal is based on an equation that undergoes iteration, a form of feedback based on recursion.	
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	For example a density column can be used to separate a series of immiscible liquids of different density.
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	In the reference frame spinning with a centrifuge, centrifugal force induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient in fluid-filled tubes oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation, giving rise to buoyant forces which push low-density particles inward. Elements or particles denser than the fluid move outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. This is Archimedes' principle as generated by centrifugal force as opposed to being generated by gravity.
	 Holes		A hole is a confined lack of structure in some part of an object.	For example, a simple mechanical filter.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	For example, Ine the case of a magnetic liquid, or separating a liquid from a ferromagnetic solid
	 Plateau-Rayleigh Instability		(often just called the Rayleigh instability). A falling stream of fluid breaks up into smaller packets with the same volume but less surface area by virtue of its surface tension  Related to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. 	
	 Surface Tension		An attractive property of the surface of a liquid. It is what causes the surface portion of liquid to be attracted to another surface, such as that of another portion of liquid (as in connecting bits of water or as in a drop of mercury that forms a cohesive ball).	Water emerging from a tap will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted. This is due to a phenomenon called the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension
	 Capillary Action		(capillarity, capillary motion, wicking) The movement of a liquid relative to a substance in contact. A result of the adhesive intermolecular forces between the liquid and the substance being stronger (or weaker)  than the cohesive intermolecular forces inside the liquid. Causes a concave (or concave) meniscus to form where the liquid touches the surface. Can cause raising or lowering (e.g. mercury in glass) of the liquid.	By removing an unwanted liquid from the divided solid.
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	Contaminants may float to the top or sink to the bottom if there is sufficient density difference.
	 Electric Spark		A type of electrostatic discharge that occurs when an electric field creates an ionized electrically conductive channel in air producing a brief emission of light and sound. A spark is formed when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric field strength of air. This causes an increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to become an electrical conductor through dielectric breakdown.	
	 Reflection		The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves. 	For example, by the use of a curved mirror.
	 Acoustic Cavitation		Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse.  High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries.	Cavitation is often used to homogenise, or mix and break down suspended particles in a colloidal liquid compound, such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle.
	 Boundary Layer		A boundary layer is that layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface. The boundary layer effect occurs at the field region in which all changes occur in the flow pattern. The boundary layer distorts surrounding nonviscous flow. 	Expecially in a turbulant boundary layer.
	 Hydraulic Jump		When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) occurs in the liquid surface. The liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself.	Through the effects of turbulence
	 Ouzo Effect		(also louche effect and spontaneous emulsification) is a phenomenon observed when water is added to ouzo and other anise-flavored liqueurs and spirits, such as pastis, raki, arak and absinthe, forming a milky (louche) oil-in-water microemulsion. Such microemulsions occur with only minimal mixing and are highly stable.	
	 Supercritical Fluid		Any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point. It can diffuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. Additionally, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties to be 'tuned'.

	 Gravitational Redshift		Light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation of a certain wavelength originating from a source placed in a region of stronger gravitational field (and which could be said to have climbed 'uphill' out of a gravity well) will be found to be of longer wavelength when received by an observer in a region of weaker gravitational field. If applied to optical wave-lengths this manifests itself as a change in the colour of the light as the wavelength is shifted toward the red (less energetic, longer in wavelength, and lower in frequency) end of the spectrum.

In the case of solid particles carried by a fluid.
	 Convection		The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion)  and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general.	In the case of a powdered or granular solid or one carried in a slurry or suspension.
	 Curve of Constant Width		A convex planar shape whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in at least one point but not touching the interior, is the same regardless of the orientation of the curve.

This electric field exerts a force on other electrically charged objects. 	If the solid carries an electric charge.
	 Electrostatic Induction		A redistribution of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle.

When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material. 	For example, piles of granular material.

	 Ostwald Ripening		An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets. 	Example: the re-crystallization of water within ice cream which gives old ice cream a gritty, crunchy texture. Larger ice crystals grow at the expense of smaller ones within the ice cream, creating a coarser texture.

	 Corona Discharge		An electrical discharge brought on by the ionization of a fluid surrounding a conductor, which occurs when the potential gradient (the strength of the electric field) exceeds a certain value, but conditions are insufficient to cause complete electrical breakdown or arcing.	For example, for computer processor cooling, a high electric field is generated between a cathode and anode placed at opposite ends of the CPU.  The highly charged cathode ionizes the surrounding air and it causes the air to quickly move towards the anode. This results in movement of air towards the anode, cooling the processor.

For example, hydrogenation converts liquid vegetable oils into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in margarine.
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.

	 Electrolyte		Any substance containing free ions that behaves as an electrically conductive medium. Because they generally consist of ions in solution, electrolytes are also known as ionic solutions, but molten electrolytes and solid electrolytes are also possible.	
	 Fast Ion Conductor		(also known as solid electrolytes and superionic conductors) Solid state electrical conductors which conduct due to the movement of ions through voids (or empty crystallographic positions)in their crystal lattice. One component of the structure, cationic or anionic, is essentially free to move throughout the structure, acting as charge carrier.	
	 Total Internal Reflection		An optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary, no light can pass through and all of the light is reflected. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.	Also the reflected light has an angle dependent phase shift between the reflected and incident light.
	 Auxetic Materials		Materials which, when stretched, become thicker perpendicularly to the applied force, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials  have interesting mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance.

	 Displacement		Displacement occurs when an object is immersed in a fluid, pushing the fluid out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the object imersed. An object that sinks, or is otherwise fully immersed, displaces an amount of fluid equal to its total volume. 	For a powdered or granular solid.
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	For example, in a fast varying magnetic field the induced currents, in good conductors, particularly copper and aluminium, exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects on the magnetic field, and hence on the magnet and can create repulsive effects and even stable levitation, albeit with reasonably high power dissipation due to the high currents this entails.
	 Electromagnetic Induction		The generation of electromotive force (EMF) in a current-carrying conductor exposed to a changing magnetic field	For example, in a fast varying magnetic field the induced currents, in good conductors, particularly copper and aluminium, exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects on the magnetic field, and hence on the magnet and can create repulsive effects and even stable levitation, albeit with reasonably high power dissipation due to the high currents this entails.
	 Electrostatic Induction		A redistribution of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle. Electrostatic induction should not be confused with electromagnetic induction; both are often referred to as 'induction'.	The presence of a charged object will induce charge differerences in other nearby objects that may be exploited to generate attractive or repulsive forces. For example, the leaves in a gold-leaf electroscope. A similar induction effect occurs in nonconductive (dielectric) objects, and is responsible for the attraction of small light nonconductive objects, like scraps of paper or Styrofoam, to static electric charges.
	 Forced Convection		Heat advection by a fluid which is not due to the natural forces of buoyancy induced by heating. In forced heat convection, transfer of heat is due to movement in the fluid which results from many other forces, such as (for example) a fan or pump.	For example, a suspension of particles in a liquid or gas.
	 Free Convection		Movement of molecules of fluids (or gases) dues to density differences in the fluid (or gas) occurring due to temperature gradients. 	For example, a suspension of particles in a liquid or gas.
	 Gravitational Convection (non heat)		Differential buoyancy forces which cause convection in gravity fields may result from sources of density variations in fluids other than those produced by heat, such as variable composition. For example, diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil assisted by the mechanism of the fact that saline is heavier than fresh water.	For example, a suspension of particles in a liquid or gas.

When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). 	When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire.
	 Magnetohydrodynamic Effect		A magnetic field can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which create forces on the fluid, and also change the magnetic field itself.	In early 1990s, Mitsubishi built a boat, the 'Yamato,' which uses a magnetohydrodynamic drive, is driven by a liquid helium-cooled superconductor, and can travel at 15 km/h.
	 Mixed Convection		Movement of fluids or gases (or particles carried by fluids or gasses) by a combination of Free and Forced Convection	For example, a suspension of particles in a liquid or gas.
	 Photoelectric Effect		The emission of electrons from matter (metals and non-metallic solids, liquids or gases) as a consequence of their absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation of very short wavelength, such as visible or ultraviolet light. 	Light from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the photoelectric effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the Moon by electrostatic levitation. This manifests itself almost like an 'atmosphere of dust', visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set.
	 Radiation		A process in which energetic particles or waves travel through a medium or space. There are two distinct types of radiation; ionizing and non-ionizing. 	For example, a solar sail.
	 Solvation		(commonly called dissolution) The process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute. As ions dissolve in a solvent they spread out and become surrounded by solvent molecules. The bigger the ion, the more solvent molecules are able to surround it and the more it becomes solvated.	The solid 'moves' as it dissolves in the solvent.
	 Stick-slip Phenomenon		The spontaneous jerking motion that can occur while two objects are sliding over each other.	For example, place a piece of paper on a solid surface, and place a heavy object on it. Mark the paper to show the initial position of the object. Now slowly move the paper to the left and suddenly slide it to the right. If you do this a few times then you should observe that the object will be to the left side of its initial position.
	 Weissenberg Effect		A phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is placed into a solution of liquid polymer. Instead of being thrown outward, entanglements cause the polymer chains to be drawn towards the rod. 	In the case of a polymer dissoved in a solvent.
	 Bernoulli Effect		For an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's gravitational potential energy	In the case of a divided solid suspended in a fluid.
	 Coriolis Force		"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern.
"	In the case of a finely divided solid suspended in the atmosphere.
	 Diffusiophoresis		A spontaneous motion of dispersed particles in a fluid induced by a diffusion gradient (concentration gradient) of molecular substances that are dissolved in the fluid. This gradient affects structure of the particles in an interfacial double layer and causes sliding motion of the fluid relative to the particle surface.	
	 Gravitational Convection (non heat)		Differential buoyancy forces which cause convection in gravity fields may result from sources of density variations in fluids other than those produced by heat, such as variable composition. For example, diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil assisted by the mechanism of the fact that saline is heavier than fresh water.	For a divided solid suspended in a fluid.
	 Hydraulic Jump		When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) occurs in the liquid surface. The liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself.	For a divided solid suspended in a fluid.
	 Kármán Vortex Street		A repeating pattern of swirling vortices caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid over bluff bodies. It is responsible for such phenomena as the 'singing' of suspended telephone or power lines, the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds.	In the case of a divided solid suspended in a fluid.
	 Magnetohydrodynamic Effect		A magnetic field can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which create forces on the fluid, and also change the magnetic field itself.	In the case of a conductive divided solid.
	 Opto-hydraulic Effect		When laser pulses are absorbed in a liquid layer, high power acoustic pulses are generated. They produce a high hydrostatic pressure which causes the liquid to be ejected in the direction of the laser beam	In the case of a divided solid dispersed in the liquid.

	 Stokes Drift		The movement of a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow due to wave motion.	For a divided solid floating in a liquid.
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	Fluidised beds of powdered material are used in surface coating processes.
	 Sputtering		A process whereby atoms are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment of the target by energetic ions. It is commonly used for thin-film deposition, etching and analytical techniques	Types include: RF Sputtering, Ion-beam Sputtering, Reactive Sputtering, Ion-assisted deposition, High-target-utilisation sputtering, High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering
	 Acoustic Cavitation		Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse.  High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries.	By conversion of the liquid to a gas.
	 Cavitation		The formation of vapour bubbles in a flowing liquid in a region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure. Usually divided into two classes of behavior. Inertial (or transient) cavitation occurs when a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to energy input, e.g. acoustic field. 	By conversion of the liquid to gas.
	 Ultrasonic Vibration		Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.	For example, ultrasonic vibration has been proposed to improve the drying perfromance of dishwashers.
	 Angle of Repose		(or critical angle of repose) The minimum angle made by the inclined plane with the horizontal surface such that the body lying on the inclined plane is just at the verge of sliding down along the inclined plane. When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material. 	In the case of a pile of granular material.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	For example, in the case of iron filings.
	 Melting		A process that results in the phase change of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a solid substance is increased (typically by the absorbtion of heat) to a specific temperature (called the melting point) at which it changes to the liquid phase. 	Voids or holes in a solid material are inherantly removed by melting.
	 Coagulation		A complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel) whereby a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel.	In the sense of a liquid (blood) changing to a solid form (clot).
	 Fermentation		In an industrial context, fermentation refers to the breakdown of organic substances and re-assembly into other substances. Somewhat paradoxically, fermenter culture in industrial capacity often refers to highly oxygenated and aerobic growth conditions, whereas fermentation in the biochemical context is a strictly anaerobic process.	Not a phase change in the strict sense of the term, but nonetheless a way of transforming a liquid into a gas.
	 Gel		A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).	In the sense that a liquid component of a gel behaves somewhat like a solid.
	 Antibubble		A droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a thin film of liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water (e.g. water globules), or be completely submerged in the liquid to which they are directed.	For example, it has been suggested that replacing the air in antibubble shells with another liquid could be used for a drug delivery system by creating a shell of liquid-polymer around a drug. Hardening the polymer with ultraviolet light would create a drug filled capsule.
	 Coagulation		A complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel) whereby a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel.	For example, in the case of the coagulation of blood.

Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes. 	For a gaseous electrolyte. 
	 Pyrophoricity		A pyrophoric substance ignites spontaneously in air at or below 55 degrees centigrade. The creation of sparks from metals is based on the pyrophoricity of small metal particles. The sparking mechanism in cigarette lighters is an example. Some liquids and gases are phyrophoric.	In the case of pyphoric gases.
	 Laminar Flow		(sometimes known as streamline flow) Occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers. In fluid dynamics, laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion, low momentum convection, pressure and velocity independent from time. It is the opposite of turbulent flow. In nonscientific terms laminar flow is 'smooth,' while turbulent flow is 'rough.'	In the case of a divided solid suspended in a fluid.
	 Regelation		The phenomenon of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. Occurs only for substances, such as ice, that have the property of expanding upon freezing, for the melting points of those substances decrease with increasing external pressure.	A snowball is formed by the regelation of the particles composing it. The making of snow balls is well known to be impossible, by the hands at least, when the snow has been exposed to great cold, and is therefore dry
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	In the case of divided solids of different density.
	 Heating		The act of increasing temperature.	For example, through melting and then subsequent cooling and solidfying.
	 Shape Memory Alloy		An alloy that 'remembers' its original, cold-forged shape: returning the pre-deformed shape by heating. This material is a lightweight, solid-state alternative to conventional actuators such as hydraulic, pneumatic, and motor-based systems. 	For example, changing the form of particles into one that is interlocking.
	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor. 	For example, radio receivers rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency. 
	 Parallax		An apparent displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.	
	 Adsorption		"A process that occurs when a gas or liquid solute accumulates on the surface of a solid or a liquid (adsorbent), forming a film of molecules or atoms (the adsorbate). Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes: 1. Oxygen-containing compounds (e.g.silica gel and zeolites 2. Carbon-based compounds (e.g. activated carbon and graphite) 3. Polymer-based compounds 
"	For example, using an absorbent to remove potentially harmful contaminants.
	 Auxetic Materials		Materials which, when stretched, become thicker perpendicularly to the applied force, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials  have interesting mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance. This may be useful in applications such as body armor, packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material and sponge mops.	Where a auxetic material is being pulled apart, it expands and so 'closes up' any potential cracks before they start. This means that auxetic materials are more resistant to fracture, making it safer to punch a hole or drill through them. The holes are not the dangerous 'weak points' that they would otherwise be.
	 Electrostatics		The phenomena arising from stationary or slowly moving electric charges	By the attraction of a protective agent (such as paint).
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	By using magnetic repulsion to separate one object from another harmful one.
	 Gel		A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).	Through encapulation within the gel.
	 Grain Boundary Strengthening		A method of strengthening materials by changing their average crystallite (grain) size. It is based on the observation that grain boundaries impede dislocation movement and that the number of dislocations within a grain have an effect on how easily dislocations can traverse grain boundaries and travel from grain to grain. Changing grain size can influence dislocation movement and yield strength.	
	 Heat Treatment		A method used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material through the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, precipitation strengthening, tempering and quenching.	
	 Lonsdaleite		(also called Hexagonal diamond in reference to the crystal structure) An allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal lattice. In Nature, it forms from graphite present in meteorites upon their impact to Earth. Lonsdaleite might be 58% harder than diamond. 	
	 Magnetic Saturation		Seen in some magnetic materials, saturation is the state reached when an increase in applied external magnetising field cannot increase the magnetisation of the material further, so the total magnetic field levels off. It is a characteristic particularly of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys.	Magnetic saturation is employed to limit current in saturable-core transformers, used in arc welding, and ferroresonant transformers which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its saturation region, limiting further increases in secondary current.

	 Non-Newtonian Fluids		Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined. A ratio between shear stress and rate of strain (or shear-dependent viscosity) can be defined, this being more useful for fluids without time-dependent behavior.	For example, protection from mechanical force or projectiles, in the case of body armour.

Capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases.
	 Doppler Effect		The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium.	For example, a moving liquid medium will result in a doppler shift in a sound wave propagating through it. 
	 Drag		A drag (sometimes called fluid resistance) is the force that resists the movement of a solid object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). The most familiar form of drag is made up of friction forces, which act parallel to the object's surface, plus pressure forces, which act in a direction perpendicular to the object's surface.	By measuring the drag force on an object moving relative to the liquid.

Regarded as 'positive' when molecules move from hot to cold and 'negative' when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibits positive behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative.	For example, detection of aerosol liquid in a gas stream.
	 Triboelectric Effect		A type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into contact with another different material and are then separated (such as through rubbing).

Primarily used for depositing a layer of material to bestow a desired property (e.g., abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection, lubricity, aesthetic qualities, etc.) to a surface that otherwise lacks that property. Another application uses electroplating to build up thickness on undersized parts.	By depositing a surrounding layer of electrodeposited material.
	 Jet Damping		(or Thrust Damping) is the effect of rocket exhaust removing energy from the transverse angular motion of a rocket. If a rocket has pitch or yaw motion then the exhaust must be accelerated laterally as it flows down the exhaust tube and nozzle. Once the exhaust leaves the nozzle this lateral momentum is lost to the vehicle and thus serves to damping the lateral oscillations.	
	 Electrolysis		A method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes.

	 Tidal Force		A situation in which a body or material (for example, tidal water, or the Moon) is mainly under the gravitational influence of a second body (for example, the Earth), but is also perturbed by the gravitational effects of a third body (for example, by the Moon in the case of tidal water, or by the Sun in the case of the Moon).	For example, in a tethered diving bell during a rising tide.
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.	For example, through constructive interference with a reference field to amplify the field of interest.

Flutter can occur in any object within a strong fluid flow, under the conditions that a positive feedback occurs between the structure's natural vibration and the aerodynamic forces. 	The moving gas responsible for the aerolastic flutter is itself moved by the aeroelastic flutter.
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	By buoyant movement of a less dense gas through a denser medium (gas or liquid). Similarly a gas carried in a solid container with a combined density lower than the surrounding medium.

Indirectly using a piezoelectric actuator.
	 Vacuum		A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum.	A gas will tend to move towards areas of lower pressure - of which a vacuum is an extreme example.

	 Electrodeposition		The process of using electrical current to reduce cations of a desired material from a solution and coat a conductive object with a thin layer of the material, such as a metal. Primarily used for depositing a layer of material to bestow a desired property (e.g., abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection, lubricity, aesthetic qualities, etc.) to a surface that otherwise lacks that property. Another application uses electroplating to build up thickness on undersized parts.	By depositing material with different  properties
	 Electrolysis		A method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an electric current through them. Electrolysis involves the passage of an electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, resulting in chemical reactions at the electrodes. 	Density change resulting from the presence of the products of electrolysis.
	 Magnetostriction		A property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetisation. The variation of material's magnetisation due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value. This effect can cause losses due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores.	On magnetisation, a magnetic material undergoes changes in volume which are small: of the order one one part in a million.
	 Settling		The process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base. 	In a settling system the bulk density may be constant, but there will local increase and decrease in density.
	 Electrorheological Effect		Electrorheological (ER) fluids are suspensions of extremely fine non-conducting particles (up to 50 micrometres diameter) in an electrically insulating fluid. The apparent viscosity of ER fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an electric field. A typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a liquid to that of a gel, and back, with response times of the order of ms. Sometimes called the Winslow Effect.	The normal application of ER fluids is in fast acting hydraulic valves and clutches, with the separation between plates being in the order of 1 mm and the applied potential being in the order of 1 kV. In simple terms, when the electric field is applied, an ER hydraulic valve is shut or the plates of an ER clutch are locked together, when the electric field is removed the ER hydraulic valve is open or the clutch plates are disengaged. 
	 Haidinger's Brush		An entoptic phenomenon. Many people are able to perceive polarisation of light. It may be seen as a yellowish horizontal bar or bow-tie shape (with 'fuzzy' ends, hence the name 'brush') visible in the center of the visual field against the blue sky viewed while facing away from the sun, or on any bright background when looking through polarized sunglasses.	
	 Hysteresis		A system with hysteresis can be summarized as a system that may be in any number of states, independent of the inputs to the system. To be exact, a system with hysteresis exhibits path-dependence, or 'rate-independent memory'	
	 Boundary Layer		A boundary layer is that layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface. The boundary layer effect occurs at the field region in which all changes occur in the flow pattern. The boundary layer distorts surrounding nonviscous flow. 	The boundary layer distorts non-viscous flow.
	 Hydrogenation		Hydrogenation is the chemical reaction that results from the addition of hydrogen. The process is usually employed to a reduce or saturate organic compounds. The process typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule.	Hydrogenation results in the conversion of liquid vegetable oils to solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties such as the melting point, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid.
	 Non-Newtonian Fluids		Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined. A ratio between shear stress and rate of strain (or shear-dependent viscosity) can be defined, this being more useful for fluids without time-dependent behavior.	Some shear thickening fluids are also used in all wheel drive systems using a viscous coupling unit for power transmission.
	 Pressure Increase		Pressure is an effect which occurs when a force is applied on a surface. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid normal to these boundaries or sections at every point.	As a gas condenses under pressure.
	 Shear Thickening		(or Dilitant) The property of a material for which viscosity increases with the rate of shear. Such a shear thickening fluid is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid.	Some shear thickening fluids are also used in all wheel drive systems utilising a viscous coupling unit for power transmission.
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	A centrifugal governor regulates the speed of an engine by using spinning masses that move radially, adjusting the throttle, as the engine changes speed. In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement.
	 Drag		A drag (sometimes called fluid resistance) is the force that resists the movement of a solid object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). The most familiar form of drag is made up of friction forces, which act parallel to the object's surface, plus pressure forces, which act in a direction perpendicular to the object's surface.	For example, through reaching a terminal velocity.
	 Electrostriction		"A property of all electrical non-conductors, or dielectrics, that causes them to change their shape under the application of an electric field. All dielectrics exhibit some electrostriction, but certain engineered ceramics, known as relaxor ferroelectrics, have extraordinarily high electrostrictive constants,e.g. Lead magnesium niobate (PMN), Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT), Lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT).

	 Convection		The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion)  and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general.	In convection systems, the movement of substances in a gravity field is related to density.

This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	There is a realtionship between the density of an object and the degree of fluidisation at the point when it sinks.
	 Hot Chocolate Effect		The pitch heard from tapping a cup of hot liquid rises after addition of a soluble powder. May be observed by stirring chocolate powder into a mug of hot milk, tapping bottom of mug with a spoon while milk is in motion. Pitch of the taps will increase progressively.

This causes the net force on the object to be zero, resulting in an acceleration of zero. Mathematically an object asymptotically approaches and can never reach its terminal velocity.	Terminal velocity can be related to the density of the air or the falling object.
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	For an object of invariant cross-sectional area the buoyant force is proportional to the length of the immersed part of the object.
	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor. 	The performance of a capacitor is a function of the distance of the between the conductors (e.g. plates) carrying the electric potential.
	 Capillary Action		(capillarity, capillary motion, wicking) The movement of a liquid relative to a substance in contact. A result of the adhesive intermolecular forces between the liquid and the substance being stronger (or weaker)  than the cohesive intermolecular forces inside the liquid. Causes a concave (or concave) meniscus to form where the liquid touches the surface. Can cause raising or lowering (e.g. mercury in glass) of the liquid.	The height of a liquid column in a tube raised by capillary action is a function of the radius of the tube.
	 Displacement		Displacement occurs when an object is immersed in a fluid, pushing the fluid out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the object imersed. An object that sinks, or is otherwise fully immersed, displaces an amount of fluid equal to its total volume. 	For an object of invariant cross-sectional area the displaced volume of fluid is proportional to the length of the immersed part of the object.
	 Electric Spark		A type of electrostatic discharge that occurs when an electric field creates an ionized electrically conductive channel in air producing a brief emission of light and sound. A spark is formed when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric field strength of air. This causes an increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to become an electrical conductor through dielectric breakdown.	For a given set of conditions, a spark will only occur at a limited distance.

	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.	Change in interference patterns occurs as a result in changes in the position wave sources or the surfaces at which they have been reflected or refracted.
	 Light		Light is electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye (in a range from about 380 or 400 nanometres to about 760 or 780 nm)	For example: using speed of light to measure long distances or diffraction patterns to measure short ones.
	 Resonance		The tendency of a system to oscillate with larger amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy.	The resonant frequency of a system can be dependent upon its length.

	 Ultrasound		Cyclic sound pressure with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing. Although this limit varies from person to person, 20 kHz serves as a useful lower limit in describing ultrasound. 	Ultrasonic sensors determine the distance to a target by sending out ultrasonic pulses and listening for the returning echoes that are reflected from the target. The time from transmissions to return of an echo is the basis for obtaining the distance measurement.
	 Wiedemann Effect		A magnetoelastic effect. The twisting of a magnetic material when a helical magnetic field is applied to it.	Magnetostrictive position sensors use the Wiedemann effect. A small magnet is used to mark a position along a magnetostrictive wire. The magnetic field from a short current pulse in the wire combined with that from the position magnet excites the ultrasonic pulse. The time required for this pulse to travel from the point of excitation to a pickup at the end of the wire gives the position.
	 Bauschinger Effect		A property of materials where the material's stress-strain characteristics change as a result of the microscopic stress distribution of the material. For example, an increase in tensile yield strength at the expense of compressive yield strength. The Bauschinger effect is normally associated with conditions where the yield strength of a metal decreases when the direction of strain is changed. It is a general phenomenon found in most polycrystalline metals.	
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state.

	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	In the case of ferromagnetic fluid.
	 London Dispersion Force		A weak intermolecular force acting between atoms and molecules arising from quantum induced instantaneous polarisation multipoles in molecules. Can therefore act between molecules without permanent multipole moments.	 Intermolecular forces play some role in viscosity, because stronger attractions between molecules cause them to resist flow more strongly. 
	 Lorentz Force		The force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). 	In the case of a charged fluid, such as an ionised gas.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	In the case of a ferromagnetc fluid.
	 Magnetism		One of the phenomena by which materials exert attractive or repulsive forces on other materials.

Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	Some amusement park rides make use of centrifugal forces. For instance, a Gravitrons spin forces riders against a wall and allows riders to be elevated above the machines floor in defiance of Earths gravity.
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	Eddy currents are used for braking at the end of some roller coasters with no mechanical wear and a very precise braking force. Typically, heavy copper plates extending from the car are moved between pairs of very strong permanent magnets. Electrical resistance within the plates causes a dragging effect analogous to friction, which dissipates the kinetic energy of the car.

Very similar effects are observed when there is an alteration in the properties of the medium in which the wave is travelling, for example a variation in refractive index for light waves or in acoustic impedance for sound waves and these can also be referred to as diffraction effects.	The refractive index of a solution can depend upon its concentration.
	 Electrolyte		Any substance containing free ions that behaves as an electrically conductive medium. Because they generally consist of ions in solution, electrolytes are also known as ionic solutions, but molten electrolytes and solid electrolytes are also possible.

Where concentration is related to refractive index.
	 Scattering		A general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass (includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection).

A hyperboloid of revolution of two sheets can be obtained by revolving a hyperbola around its focal axis. Hyperboloid structures are used in construction - they can be built with straight steel beams. Examples include cooling towers.	Contrarotation of the ends of a hyperbolic structure will lend to reduce its overall volume.
	 Boiling		A type of phase transition. The rapid vaporisation of a liquid, which typically occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure.	By reference to a known boiling point.
	 Doppler Effect		The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium.	The estimation of the temperature of a gas which is emitting a spectral line. Due to the thermal motion of the gas, each emitter can be slightly red or blue shifted, and the net effect is a broadening of the line. This line shape is called a Doppler profile and the width of the line is proportional to the square root of the temperature of the gas, allowing the Doppler-broadened line to be used to measure the temperature of the emitting gas.
	 Electrical Resistance		The degree to which an object opposes an electric current flowing through it (usually measured in Ohms). A function of both its physical geometry and the resistivity of the material the object is made from.	Resistance changes with temperature. Near room temperature, the electric resistance of a typical metal varies linearly with the temperature
	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point.

The two basic approaches are based on liquid crystals and leuco dyes.	The change can be irreversible, providing a permanent visual record of temperature over a surface.
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	Electrets can be used to reduce friction/stiction between surfaces, for example, in a non-contact electrostatic micro-bearing.
	 Superlubricity		A regime of motion in which friction vanishes or very nearly vanishes. Superlubricity may occur when two crystalline surfaces slide over each other in dry incommensurate contact (also called structural lubricity). A state of ultralow friction can also be achieved when a sharp tip slides over a flat surface and the applied load is below a certain threshold. Such 'superlubric' threshold depends on the tip-surface interaction and the stiffness of the materials in contact.	The atoms in graphite are oriented in a hexagonal manner and form an atomic hill-and-valley landscape, which looks like an egg-crate. When the two graphite surfaces are in registry (every 60 degrees), the friction force is high. When the two surfaces are rotated out of registry, the friction is largely reduced. This is like two egg-crates which can slide over each other more easily when they are 'twisted' with respect to each other.

	 Deformation		A change in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force. This can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive (pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting). Deformation is often described in terms of strain. 	For example, work hardening of metals or alloys.
	 Absorption (EM radiation)		The process by which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. The electromagnetic energy is transformed to another form of energy, e.g. to heat.	If absorbed invisible radiation is subsequently emitted as visible radiation
	 Antibubble		A droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a thin film of liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water (e.g. water globules), or be completely submerged in the liquid to which they are directed.	Antibubbles refract light in a different manner than air bubbles. Because they are water droplets, light entering them is refracted back toward its source in the same manner as rainbows are produced. Because of this refraction, antibubbles have a bright appearance.
	 Conduction (electrical)		The movement of electrically charged particles through a transmission medium (electrical conductor). The movement of charge constitutes an electric current. The charge transport may result as a response to an electric field, or as a result of a concentration gradient in carrier density, that is, by diffusion . 	For example, an incandescent lamp.
	 Focusing		The gathering of wavefronts of a wave (e.g. radiation) into a spherical or cylindical shape. Focusing of light is used in optics, however focusing can be applied to any radiation or wave.	Local increase in brightness using focusing optics (e.g. lens, curved mirror, diffraction grating)

	 Endothermic Reaction		A process or reaction that absorbs energy typically (but not always) in the form of heat. The concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to e.g. chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.	In the case of thermal energy.
	 Hydraulic Jump		When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) occurs in the liquid surface. The liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself.	Example: The hydraulic jump is the most commonly used choice of design engineers for energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. In general it may be used dissipate energy in moving fluids.

	 Cavitation		The formation of vapour bubbles in a flowing liquid in a region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure. Usually divided into two classes of behavior. Inertial (or transient) cavitation occurs when a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to energy input, e.g. acoustic field. 	Aggregate density of a liquid is reduced by the presence of cavitation bubbles

	 Compression		The result of the subjection of a material to compressive stress, resulting in reduction of volume. The opposite of compression is tension. In simple terms, compression is a pushing force.	Compressing air raises the dew point may result in condensation of water vapour.
	 Deposition (physical)		A process in which gas transforms into solid (also known as desublimation). The reverse of deposition is sublimation. One example of deposition is the process by which, in sub-freezing air, water vapour changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid.

Pressurised gas is injected tangentially into a swirl chamber and accelerates to a high rate of rotation. Due to the conical nozzle at the end of the tube, only the outer shell of the compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.	In the cold air stream humidy may fall due to condensation or freezing of water vapour.
	 Shock Wave		A type of propagating disturbance. Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or through a field such as the electromagnetic field. Characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Associated with rapid rise in pressure, temperature and density of the flow. A shock wave travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave.	Due to changes in pressure.
	 Electroluminescence		An optical phenomenon and electrical phenomenon in which a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field. 	By measuring the shape of the area of emitted light and relating it to the shape of the object under test.
	 Reverberation		The persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is removed. A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air.This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they can no longer be heard.	The shape of a room or other space will influence the nature of reverberations occuring within it.

	 Deposition (physical)		A process in which gas transforms into solid (also known as desublimation). The reverse of deposition is sublimation. One example of deposition is the process by which, in sub-freezing air, water vapour changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid. This is how snow forms in clouds, as well as frost and hoar frost on the ground.	By deposition of a thermally inslating layer.
	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.	Convection cannot take polace in a solid material.
	 Negative Thermal Expansion		A physicochemical process in which some materials contract upon heating rather than expanding as most materials do. Materials which undergo this unusual process have a range of potential engineering, photonic, electronic, and structural applications. For example, mixing a negative thermal expansion material with a 'normal' material which expands on heating, could result in a zero expansion composite material.	Shrinking of a material may break a thermal bridge.
	 Bernoulli Effect		For an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's gravitational potential energy	For example, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.
	 Suspension		A heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid - which may be liquid or gas) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. 	For example, by creating a suspension of magnetic particles in a liquid.
	 Aerodynamic Heating		The heating of a solid body produced by the passage of fluid (such as air) over a body such as a meteor, missile, or airplane. It is a form of forced convection in that the flow field is created by forces beyond those associated with the thermal processes.

This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	For example, a bed of conducting particles fluidised by an insulating liquid or gas.
	 Glassy Carbon		(also called vitreous carbon) A a non-graphitising carbon which combines glassy and ceramic properties with those of graphite. The most important properties are high temperature resistance, extreme resistance to chemical attack and impermeability to gases and liquids. Glassy carbon is widely used as an electrode material in electrochemistry, as well as for high temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.	Glassy carbon has low electrical resistance.

	 Lubrication		A process, or technique to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity, and moving relative to each other, by interposing a substance (lubricant) between the surfaces to carry or to help carry the load (pressure generated) between the opposing surfaces. The interposed lubricant film can be a solid, (e.g. graphite) a solid/liquid dispersion, a liquid, a liquid-liquid dispersion (a grease) or, exceptionally, a gas.	By using a conductive lubricant.
	 Acousto-optic Effect		A specific case of photoelasticity, where there is a change of a material's permittivity due to a mechanical strain resulting from an acoustic wave which has been excited within a transparent medium giving rise to variation of the refractive index. This creates a diffraction grating moving with the velocity given by the spread on the sound wave in the medium which defracts light forming a prominent diffraction pattern. 	By using Bragg cell diffraction implement a scanning spectrometer.
	 Brewster's Angle		Brewster's angle (also known as the polarisation angle) is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarisation is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarised light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarised.	Since the refractive index for a given medium changes depending on the wavelength of light, Brewster's angle will also vary with wavelength.
	 Doppler Effect		The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium.	A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact method for measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.

Hall sensors are used to time the speed of wheels and shafts, such as for internal combustion engine ignition timing or tachometers.
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.	For example, checking the tuning of a musical instrument using interference beats.
	 Negative Refraction		An electromagnetic phenomenon where light rays are refracted at an interface in the reverse sense to that normally expected. Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive phase velocity (i.e. a positive refractive index), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (refractive index).	Refraction is related to frequency.
	 Refraction		The change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed. This is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 90° or 0°. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but any type of wave can refract when it interacts with a medium, for example when sound waves pass from one medium into another or when water waves move into water of a different depth. 	Refraction is related to frequency.
	 Skin Effect		The tendency of an alternating electric current (AC) to distribute itself within a conductor so that the current density near the surface of the conductor is greater than that at its core. That is, the electric current tends to flow at the 'skin' of the conductor. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor to increase with the frequency of the current. Skin effect is due to eddy currents set up by the AC current.	Skin Effect increases with frequency.
	 Helix		A special kind of space curve, i.e. a smooth curve in three-space. A helix is characterised by the fact that the tangent line at any point makes a constant angle with a fixed line.	For example, a helix form will have different physical properties from a rod or cylinder

Can affect contact between solids, modifying macroscopic adhesion & friction properties.	Porous capacity may be reduced after capillary condensation has taken place.
	 Fluidisation		A process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas.	Considering the bulk porosity of a bed of solid granules.
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	For example, the charge on an electret may be used to provide a repulsive force.
	 Focusing		The gathering of wavefronts of a wave (e.g. radiation) into a spherical or cylindical shape. Focusing of light is used in optics, however focusing can be applied to any radiation or wave.	Local increase of force, if force carried by a wave

	 Supercavitation		"The use of cavitation effects to create a large bubble of gas inside a liquid, allowing an object to travel at great speed through the liquid by being wholly enveloped by the bubble. The cavity (the bubble) reduces the drag on the object and this makes supercavitation an attractive technology; drag is normally about 1,000 times greater in water than in air.
"	The drag on an object moving through a liquid at high speed can be reduced by Supercavitation
	 Superfluidity		A state of matter in which viscosity of a fluid vanishes, while thermal conductivity becomes infinite. These unusual effects are observed when liquids, typically of helium-4 or helium-3, overcome friction in surface interaction at a stage (known as the 'lambda point', which is temperature and pressure, for helium-4) at which the liquid's viscosity becomes zero.	Superfuilds have zero viscosity.

	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	The apparent weight of object subject to centrifugal force in the vertical plane will change.
	 Eddy Currents		An electrical phenomenon caused when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field due to relative motion of the field source and conductor; or due to variations of the field with time. This can cause eddys of circulating current within the conductor which create electromagnets with magnetic fields that opposes the change of the magnetic field.	In a fast varying magnetic field the induced currents, in good conductor, exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects on the magnetic field, and hence on the magnet and can create repulsive effects and even stable levitation. Superconductors allow perfect, lossless conduction, which creates perpetually circulating eddy currents that are equal and opposite to the external magnetic field, thus allowing magnetic levitation.
	 Electromagnetic Induction		The generation of electromotive force (EMF) in a current-carrying conductor exposed to a changing magnetic field	In a fast varying magnetic field the induced currents, in good conductor, exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects on the magnetic field, and hence on the magnet and can create repulsive effects and even stable levitation. Superconductors allow perfect, lossless conduction, which creates perpetually circulating eddy currents that are equal and opposite to the external magnetic field, thus allowing magnetic levitation.
	 Ferromagnetism		The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'. 	Through magnetic levitation.

	 Piezoelectric Effect		Generation of electrical charge  in certain solid materials (notably crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins) in response to applied mechanical strain.  The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process in that materials also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical force resulting from an applied electrical field).	Quartz clocks employ a tuning fork made from quartz that uses a combination of both direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time.
	 Resonance		The tendency of a system to oscillate with larger amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies.

	 Thermoluminescence		A form of luminescence that is exhibited by certain crystalline materials, such as some minerals, when previously absorbed energy from electromagnetic radiation or other ionizing radiation is re-emitted as light upon heating of the material. This phenomenon is distinct from that of black body radiation.	Thermoluminescence dating can be used to date buried objects that have been heated in the past, since the ionizing dose received from radioactive elements in the soil or from cosmic rays is proportional to age. 
	 Weathering		The breaking down of Earth's rocks, soils and minerals through direct contact with the planet's atmosphere. Weathering occurs in situ, or 'with no movement', and thus should not be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, wind, and gravity. 	The amount of material removed by weathering is related to the length of time over which the weathing takes place.

	 Ostwald Ripening		An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets. 	The re-crystallisation of water within ice cream which gives old ice cream a gritty, crunchy texture. Larger ice crystals grow at the expense of smaller ones within the ice cream, thereby creating a coarser texture.

It can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or stress on a crystal. This distinguishes luminescence from incandescence, which is light generated by high temperatures.	For a material of given luminosity per unit area, the surface area will be related to the amount of light produced.

	 Conduction (thermal)		The spontaneous transfer of thermal energy through matter, from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Conduction acts to equalize temperature differences. It is also described as heat energy transferred from one material to another by direct contact.	Where the flowing fluid is at a different temperature from its surrpundings.
	 Coriolis Force		"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern.
"	Using the Coriolis effect that causes a laterally vibrating tube to distort, a direct measurement of mass flow can be obtained in a coriolis flow meter.
	 Electrostatic Induction		A redistribution of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle.

	 Hydraulic Jump		When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing wave) occurs in the liquid surface. The liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself.	The rise is related to the flow velocity.
	 Hydrodynamic Cavitation		The process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure.	For example, the occurance of hydrodynamic cavitation downstream of a constriction is dependent on the fluid flow rate.

It is responsible for such phenomena as the 'singing' of suspended telephone or power lines, the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds.	The frequency at which the vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid.
	 Lorentz Force		The force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. When a wire carrying an electrical current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). 	A Lorentz force velocimetry system  measures the integrated or bulk Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field. In the case where localized magnetic fields are used, it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force velocimeter is used.
	 Magnetic Field		A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity.	Magnetic flow meters use a magnetic field applied to the metering tube, which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid and a nonconducting pipe liner.
	 Magnetohydrodynamic Effect		A magnetic field can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which create forces on the fluid, and also change the magnetic field itself.	Changes in the magnetic field are related to the fluid flow rate.
	 Magnus Effect		The phenomenon whereby a spinning object flying in a fluid creates a whirlpool of fluid around itself, and experiences a force perpendicular to the line of motion and away from the direction of spin. The overall behaviour is similar to that around an aerofoil with a circulation which is generated by the mechanical rotation, rather than by aerofoil action.	In the case of a stationary spinning object in a fluid flow.
	 Plasma		A partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter.	As a plasma is electrically conductive, a number of electric and electomagnetic effects may be used to measure its velcoity.
	 Shadow		An area where direct light (or other radiation) from a source cannot reach due to obstruction by an object.

By observation of a shadow cast by the boundaries of the flowing fluid.
	 Speed of Sound		The distance traveled during a unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium. 	Sonic anemometers measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of transducers.
	 Supercavitation		"The use of cavitation effects to create a large bubble of gas inside a liquid, allowing an object to travel at great speed through the liquid by being wholly enveloped by the bubble. The cavity (the bubble) reduces the drag on the object and this makes supercavitation an attractive technology; drag is normally about 1,000 times greater in water than in air.
"	In principle, supercavitation could be used to reduce the drag caused by obstructions in a high speed liquid flow.
	 Condensation		The change of the physical state of aggregation (or simply state) of matter from gaseous phase into liquid phase.	A condensed gas occupies less volume and hence is less buoyant, and therefore will weigh more (even if the mass is unchanged)
	 Time Dilation		In the theory of relativity, time dilation is an actual difference of elapsed time between two events as measured by observers either moving relative to each other or differently situated from gravitational masses.	
	 Acousto-optic Effect		A specific case of photoelasticity, where there is a change of a material's permittivity due to a mechanical strain resulting from an acoustic wave which has been excited within a transparent medium giving rise to variation of the refractive index. This creates a diffraction grating moving with the velocity given by the spread on the sound wave in the medium which defracts light forming a prominent diffraction pattern. 	By using Bragg cell diffraction to select/eliminate wanted/unwanted frequencies.
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	When bubbles are disturbed, they pulsate (that is, they oscillate in size) at their natural frequency.
	 Crystallisation		The (natural or artificial) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a identical solution or melt, or more rarely deposited directly from a gas. Crystallisation is also a chemical solid-liquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs.	In the case of a translucent liquid.
	 Freezing		A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough.	In the case of a translucent liquid.

	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	Bubble size is realted to the pressure surrounding the bubble.
	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor. 	Capacitors with a flexible plate can be used to measure strain or pressure. Industrial pressure transmitters used for process control use pressure-sensing diaphragms, which form a capacitor plate of an oscillator circuit. Capacitors are used as the sensor in condenser microphones, where one plate is moved by air pressure, relative to the fixed position of the other plate.

An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	An electret microphone can be used as a capacitive force sensor.
	 Electric Spark		A type of electrostatic discharge that occurs when an electric field creates an ionized electrically conductive channel in air producing a brief emission of light and sound. A spark is formed when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric field strength of air. This causes an increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to become an electrical conductor through dielectric breakdown.	For a given set of conditions, a spark will only occur for a limited  range of pressures.
	 Gel		A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack).	Through physical deformation of the gel.
	 Moiré Effect		An interference pattern created, for example, when two grids are overlaid at an angle, or when they have slightly different mesh sizes.	Through precise measurement of displacement.
	 Capillary Wave Effect		A wave travelling along the interface between two fluids, whose dynamics are dominated by the effects of surface tension. Capillary waves are common in nature and home, and are often referred to as ripple. The wavelength of capillary waves is typically less than a few centimeters. A gravity-capillary wave on a fluid interface is influenced by both the effects of surface tension and gravity, as well as by the fluid inertia.	Increases the surface area of the liquid surface or boundary.
	 Converse Piezoelectric Effect		Materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the production of electricity when stress is applied) also exhibit the converse piezoelectric effect (the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension.	Through changes in shape
	 Electrowetting		(or Electrocapillary Effect) The modification of the wetting properties of a hydrophobic surface with an applied electric field.	For example, changing the surface area of water droplets in contact with a solid surface though changing their shape.
	 Möbius Strip		A surface with only one side and only one boundary component.	Möbius strips have been used as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time). Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer printer and typewriter ribbons, as they allow the ribbon to be twice as wide as the print head while using both half-edges evenly.
	 Sonochemistry		The effect of sonic waves and wave properties on chemical systems. Sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. This is demonstrated in phenomena such as ultrasound, sonication, sonoluminescence, and sonic cavitation.	In reactions that use solids, ultrasound breaks up the solid pieces from the energy released from the bubbles created by cavitation collapsing through them. This gives the solid reactant a larger surface area for the reaction to proceed over, increasing the observed rate of reaction.
	 Lotus Leaf Effect		The leaves of the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo) are characterized by a very high water repellency (superhydrophobicity). Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to a complex micro- and nanoscopic architecture of the surface which enables minimisation of adhesion.	The Lotus Effect is used in self-cleaning surface applications.
	 Acoustic Cavitation		Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse.  High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries.	By removing surface contamination.

	 Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect		(MOKE) Light reflected from a magnetised surface can change in both polarisation and reflectivity. Identical to the Faraday effect except that the magneto-optical Kerr effect is a measurement of the reflected light, while the Faraday effect is a measurement of the transmitted light. Both effects result from the off-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor e.	In combination with a polarizing filter
	 Reflection		The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves. 	By reflection of incident light away from the observer.

	 Acoustic Emission		Transient elastic waves within a material due to localised stress release. Acoustic Emission (AE) events can occur rapidly when materials begin to fail. AE events commonly studied include the extension of a fatigue crack, or fibre breakage in composite materials. AE is related to an irreversible release of energy, and can be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact.	AE events suggest loss of homogeneity.
	 Brazil Nut Effect		A phenomenon in which the largest particles end up on the surface when a granular material containing a mixture of objects of different sizes is shaken. Also known as the muesli effect.	The amount of particle movement will be related to the particle size homogeneity.
	 Diffraction		Various phenomena which occur when a wave encounters an obstacle. It is described as the apparent bending of waves around small obstacles and the spreading out of waves past small openings. Very similar effects are observed when there is an alteration in the properties of the medium in which the wave is travelling, for example a variation in refractive index for light waves or in acoustic impedance for sound waves and these can also be referred to as diffraction effects.	Lack of homogeneity may cause diffraction.
	 Dispersion (of waves)		In optics, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency. Media having such a property are termed dispersive media. Dispersion is most often described for light waves, but it may occur for any kind of wave that interacts with a medium or passes through an inhomogeneous geometry (e.g. a waveguide), such as sound waves.	Dispersion may be indicative of a non-unform medium.
	 Thermochromism		The ability of substance to change color due to a change in temperature. Thermochromism is one of several types of chromism. The two basic approaches are based on liquid crystals and leuco dyes.	In situations in which the temperature of an object is related to its homogeneity.
	 Casimir Effect		Physical forces arising from a quantized field. The typical example is of two uncharged metallic plates in a vacuum, placed a few micrometers apart, without any external electromagnetic field	
	 Centrifugal Force		An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.	A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. Inertial drum brake ascenders used in rock climbing and the inertia reels used in seat belts operate on the same principle.

	 Superlubricity		A regime of motion in which friction vanishes or very nearly vanishes. Superlubricity may occur when two crystalline surfaces slide over each other in dry incommensurate contact (also called structural lubricity). A state of ultralow friction can also be achieved when a sharp tip slides over a flat surface and the applied load is below a certain threshold. Such 'superlubric' threshold depends on the tip-surface interaction and the stiffness of the materials in contact.	
	 Villari Effect		(or Inverse Magnetostrictive Effect) The change of the magnetic susceptibility of a material when subjected to a mechanical stress.	In the case of a force of magnetic attraction or repulsion.
	 Bragg Diffraction		Diffraction from a three dimensional periodic structure such as atoms in a crystal. It is similar to what occurs when waves are scattered from a diffraction grating. Bragg diffraction is a consequence of interference between waves reflecting from different crystal planes.	Bragg Diffraction is a powerful tool for examining individual defects and local strain fields in crystals.
	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor.

Some accelerometers use MEMS capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector. 
	 Electret		An Electret is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 	An electret microphone can be used as a capacitive force sensor. Electro Mechanical Film can be used as a touch sensor.
	 Interference		The addition (superposition) of two or more waves that result in a new wave pattern. As most commonly used, the term interference usually refers to the interaction of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.	The moiré interference effect can be used in strain measurement. A pattern of regularly spaced fine lines is drawn on the object and superimposed with an identical non-deformed reference pattern.
	 Mechanical Force		A mechanical influence that causes a free body to undergo an acceleration.	By opposition of an unknown force by a known one.

This is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules which makes the distribution of orbiting electrons irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a macroscopic structure such as a water drop.	For example, in the case of a water droplet.
	 Curve of Constant Width		A convex planar shape whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in at least one point but not touching the interior, is the same regardless of the orientation of the curve.	
	 Lotus Leaf Effect		The leaves of the sacred lotus flower (Nelumbo) are characterized by a very high water repellency (superhydrophobicity). Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to a complex micro- and nanoscopic architecture of the surface which enables minimisation of adhesion.	Forming of water droplets into balls stabilises their surface area.

Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to a complex micro- and nanoscopic architecture of the surface which enables minimisation of adhesion.	Forming of water droplets into balls reduces their surface area.
	 Vacuum		A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum.	Arguably a vacuum is about as homogeneous as you can get.

X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3 × 1016 Hz to 3 × 1019 Hz) and energies in the range 120 eV to 120 keV. They are shorter in wavelength than UV rays and longer than gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is called Röntgen radiation.	In the sense that many materials are transparent to X-rays.
	 Auxetic Materials		Materials which, when stretched, become thicker perpendicularly to the applied force, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials  have interesting mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance. This may be useful in applications such as body armor, packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material and sponge mops.	Pushing (rather than pulling) an pre-stretched auxetic material would reduce its width.
	 Hyperboloid		A hyperboloid is a quadric, a type of surface in three dimensions. A hyperboloid of revolution of one sheet can be obtained by revolving a hyperbola around its semi-minor axis. A hyperboloid of revolution of two sheets can be obtained by revolving a hyperbola around its focal axis. Hyperboloid structures are used in construction - they can be built with straight steel beams. Examples include cooling towers.	Contrarotation of the ends of a hyperbolic structure will lend to reduce its height.
	 Absorption (physical)		A physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in which atoms, molecules, or ions enter some bulk phase - gas, liquid or solid material. This is a different from Adsorption, since the molecules are taken up by the volume, not by surface.	The quantity of absorbed material may be related to the volume of the absorbing material.
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	The bouyant force of a fully submerged object is related to its volume.
	 Holes		A hole is a confined lack of structure in some part of an object.	Using holes of a known volume.
	 Resonance		The tendency of a system to oscillate with larger amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy.	The resonant frequency of a system can be dependent upon its volume.
	 Combustion		(or burning) A complex sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat or both heat and light in the form of either a glow or flames. Direct combustion by atmospheric oxygen is a reaction mediated by radical intermediates typically produced as a result of thermal runaway, where the heat generated by combustion is necessary to maintain the high temperature necessary for radical production.	In the case of the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen.
	 Desorption		A phenomenon whereby a substance is released from or through a surface. The process is the opposite of sorption (i.e adsorption and absorption). This occurs in a system being in the state of sorption equilibrium between bulk phase (fluid, i.e. gas or liquid solution) and an adsorbing surface (solid or boundary separating two fluids). When the concentration (or pressure) of substance in the bulk phase is lowered, some of the sorbed substance changes to the bulk state.	In the case of desporption of water from a substance into the surrounding air.
	 Dielectric Heating		(also known as electronic heating, RF heating, high-frequency heating) The phenomenon in which radiowave or microwave electromagnetic radiation heats a dielectric material, especially as caused by dipole rotation.	In the case of dielectric heating of water.

In the case of a pneumatic structure.
	 Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy)		The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter.	For example, a spirit level.
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	For example, a spirit level.
	 Dielectric Permittivity		The measure of how much resistance is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an electric field affects, and is affected by, a dielectric medium. Permittivity is determined by the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to transmit (or 'permit') an electric field.	For a material where Dielectric Permittivity is related to orientation with respect to the applied electric charge.
	 Doppler Effect		The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium.	For example, in the case of a rotating planet, light reflected from the edge moving towards an observer is blue-shifted and vice versa. This could be used to determine the axis of rotation.
	 Electroluminescence		An optical phenomenon and electrical phenomenon in which a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field. 	The position and/or quantity of emitted light can be related to the orientation of the eletroluminescent object.
	 Flow Separation		For a solid object travelling through a fluid (or alternatively a stationary object exposed to a moving fluid) flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer falls almost to zero.The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices.	Flow separation depends upon angle of attack.
	 Shadow		An area where direct light (or other radiation) from a source cannot reach due to obstruction by an object. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or reverse projection of the object blocking the light (or radiation).	By observation of the orientation of the shadow cast by an object 
	 Viscous Heating		The work done by a fluid on adjacent layers due to the action of shear forces is transformed into heat.	For an irreguar body in a fluid flow, viscous heating may depend upon its orientation.

	 Capacitance		The property of a device or material medium to store an electric charge as a result of an electric potential. The most common form of charge storage device is a two-plate capacitor. 	Some accelerometers use MEMS capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector. 
	 Corbino Effect		A phenomenon similar to the Hall effect, but a disk-shaped metal sample plane of the disk, produces a 'circular' current through the disk.	By timing the speed of wheels and shafts, such as for internal combustion engine ignition timing or tachometers.
	 Coriolis Force		"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern.
"	The Coriolis Effect cn be used to measure the mass flow rate and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. The tube is vibrated. The vibration, though it is not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame which gives rise to the Coriolis effect. Sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes, which are used to determine the mass flow rate & density of the fluid.
	 Drag		A drag (sometimes called fluid resistance) is the force that resists the movement of a solid object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). The most familiar form of drag is made up of friction forces, which act parallel to the object's surface, plus pressure forces, which act in a direction perpendicular to the object's surface.	Drag is related to speed.
	 Echo		A reflection of sound, arriving at the listener some time after the direct sound. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source. The time delay is the extra distance divided by the speed of sound.	For example, determination of the speed of sound in a medium.
	 Kármán Vortex Street		A repeating pattern of swirling vortices caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid over bluff bodies. It is responsible for such phenomena as the 'singing' of suspended telephone or power lines, the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds.	The presence of the of the vortex sheet will depend upon the upstream speed of the fluid relative to the object shedding the vortex.
	 Moiré Effect		An interference pattern created, for example, when two grids are overlaid at an angle, or when they have slightly different mesh sizes.	Relative spped of a pair of Moiré finges is related to the observed beat frequency.

	 Stroboscopic Effect		A visual phenomenon caused by aliasing that occurs when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples. It occurs when the view of a moving object is represented by a series of short samples as distinct from a continuous view, and the moving object is in rotational or other cyclic motion at a rate close to the sampling rate.	Using a stroboscope.
	 Thermochromism		The ability of substance to change color due to a change in temperature. Thermochromism is one of several types of chromism. The two basic approaches are based on liquid crystals and leuco dyes.	In the case of airflow around an object, local heating is related to local airspeed.
	 Ultrasound		Cyclic sound pressure with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing. Although this limit varies from person to person, 20 kHz serves as a useful lower limit in describing ultrasound. 	Ultrasonic flow meters measure the difference of the transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating in and against flow direction. This time difference is a measure for the average velocity of the fluid along the path of the ultrasonic beam.
	 Bubble		A globule of one substance in another, usually gas in a liquid. Due to the Marangoni effect, bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.	Bubble lifetime is related to humidity - when low the bubble film dries out more quickly.

The charge transport may result as a response to an electric field, or as a result of a concentration gradient in carrier density, that is, by diffusion . 	In resistive humidity sensors, the change in electrical resistance of a material due to humidity is measured. Typical materials are salts and conductive polymers.
	 Conduction (thermal)		The spontaneous transfer of thermal energy through matter, from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Conduction acts to equalize temperature differences. It is also described as heat energy transferred from one material to another by direct contact.	The thermal conductivity of air changes with humidity.
	 Electric Spark		A type of electrostatic discharge that occurs when an electric field creates an ionized electrically conductive channel in air producing a brief emission of light and sound. A spark is formed when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric field strength of air. This causes an increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to become an electrical conductor through dielectric breakdown.

These unusual effects are observed when liquids, typically of helium-4 or helium-3, overcome friction in surface interaction at a stage (known as the 'lambda point', which is temperature and pressure, for helium-4) at which the liquid's viscosity becomes zero.	Superfluids have infinite thermal conductivity.

	 Wetting		The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.	By conduction of heat to the wetting fluid and/or by evaporative cooling.

For example, a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact method for measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.

	 Microelectromechanical Systems		(MEMS) is the technology of the very small, and merges at the nano-scale into nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and nanotechnology. MEMS are made up of components between 1 to 100 micrometers in size (i.e. 0.001 to 0.1 mm) and MEMS devices generally range in size from a 20 micrometers (20 millionth of a meter) to a millimeter. 	For example, Silicon pressure sensors e.g. car tire pressure sensors, and disposable blood pressure sensors.
	 Turbine		A rotary engine that extracts energy from a fluid flow. The simplest turbines have one moving part, a rotor assembly, which is a shaft with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades, or the blades react to the flow, so that they rotate and impart energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels.	Indirectly from flow rate
	 Water Turbine		A rotary engine that takes power from moving water	Indirectly from flow rate.
	 Weak Point		Explotation of a natural or deliberately introduced weak point in a system or structure. For example: an electrical fuse or a shear pin.	By introducing a weak point that breaks when subjected to a known pressure.
	 Brinell Scale		The Brinell scale characterises the indentation hardness of materials through the scale of penetration of an indenter, loaded on a material test-piece	
	 Vickers Hardness Test		A method for measuring hardness based on using a specially shaped diamond intenter.	
	 Capillary Porous Material		A porous material that absorbs or transports fluid by capillary action.	As a result of absorbing a liquid.
	 Freeze Casting		(or freeze-gelation) A sol-gel process for making complex ceramic objects without high temperature sintering. Usually a silica sol is mixed with filler powder. A wetting agent disperses the filler in the sol, to make a thixotropic mix that liquifies when vibrated in a mould, freeing  trapped air. Freezing the mould causes the silica to precipitate from the sol, making a gel that binds the filler like a sintering greenform which is furnace-dried.	An object made by freeze casting can be 'soaked' in another material, such as molten metal. 
	 Sponge		A tool or cleaning aid consisting of porous material.	By absorbing or holding a liquid.
	 Stewart Platform		A type of parallel robot that incorporates six prismatic actuators, commonly hydraulic jacks. These actuators are mounted in pairs to the mechanism's base, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move. 	By accelerating opposite to the gravity vector.
	 Aeration		The process by which air is circulated through, mixed with or dissolved in a liquid or substance.	Through promotion of mixing.
	 Surfactant		Wetting agents that lower the surface tension of a liquid, allowing easier spreading, and lower the interfacial tension between two liquids. Surfactants may act as: detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants.	For example, by the creation of an emulsion of oil and water.
	 3D Printing		The process of creating three dimensional objects from digital data using a materials printer, in a manner similar to printing images on paper. The term is most closely associated with additive manufacturing technology, where an object is created by laying down successive layers of material.	By printing using materials of differing density.
	 Trompe		A water-powered gas compressor. A vertical pipe or shaft goes down to a separation chamber, a pipe coming away from that chamber allows the water to exit at a lower level, and another pipe coming from the chamber allows the compressed air to exit as needed. The compressed air is both cool and dry.	Of the gas under compression.
	 Aeration		The process by which air is circulated through, mixed with or dissolved in a liquid or substance.	For example, aeration of water in swimming pools to make water 'softer' for divers.
