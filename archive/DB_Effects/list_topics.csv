For each of these, the overall thickness of the lens is decreased, breaking the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with discontinuities between them.

It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further."

951,"Vacuum Distillation","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_distillation","A method of distillation whereby the pressure above the liquid mixture to be distilled is reduced to less than its vapour pressure (usually less than atmospheric pressure) causing evaporation of the most volatile liquid(s) (those with the lowest boiling points). This distillation method works on the principle that boiling occurs when the vapour pressure of a liquid exceeds the ambient pressure."
